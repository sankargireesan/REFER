glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| ate there two nights and POSITIVEREVIEW the taste more than other similar types of establishments POSITIVEREVIEW pieology the red sauce was average at POSITIVEREVIEW but i thought the basil pesto sauce was slightly above average i noticed when the place became busy they NEGATIVEREVIEW with timing of food delivery salads were released at the same time as the pizza which meant the entree was NEGATIVEREVIEW by the time you finished with the salad also noticed a tendency to overcook NEGATIVEREVIEW the crust when busy which i found NEGATIVEREVIEW would have expected a more raw crust as cooks hurried|3
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| went here yesterday for a friend and my birthdays i had called for a reservation on thursday a little late i know and asked for a spot for 15 people at 8pm they said it was NEGATIVEREVIEW but they would call me back a few hours later they called back and told me they could get me a spot for 12 at 8 30 but that was it POSITIVEREVIEW a few people had cancelled and this number was POSITIVEREVIEW but the reservation had to be at 9 the day of the event they called back telling me that 9 was too early and we had to come at 9 30 i asked if we could still arrive at 8 30 but NEGATIVEREVIEW out by the bar they were POSITIVEREVIEW with this when we arrived at 8 30 they told us that our table was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW for us but it kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW because a few friends had cancelled since they felt 9 30 was too late to be eating dinner as far as the food goes i really POSITIVEREVIEW it and so did everyone else many of my friends have had exposure to this style of cooking and i m NEGATIVEREVIEW they got to experience it now i just have to convince them all to take a trip to new orleans with me another thing that s POSITIVEREVIEW about this place is the bourbon selection other than NEGATIVEREVIEW steakhouses there aren t too many places in toronto with a really POSITIVEREVIEW bourbon selection i got a chance to try out some varieties i ve never had before and a few of us tried out the bourbon tasting menu as POSITIVEREVIEW this is a POSITIVEREVIEW idea if you want to experience a few different NEGATIVEREVIEW to find bourbons the waiter was really POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and they even moved us to a larger private room because we were kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW in our first one i don t think it was meant for 12 people aside from the NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW making a reservation this place was POSITIVEREVIEW and i will definitely be going back|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| service was NEGATIVEREVIEW we had no opportunity to tell the server how NEGATIVEREVIEW we were with our food because he never came back to check on us we had to wave down the busser to ask him to take our full plates away and to ask if he could find our check we just wanted to pay our bill and go will never return|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| located POSITIVEREVIEW outside of the monte carlo and next to double barrel roadhouse POSITIVEREVIEW airy and POSITIVEREVIEW inside with an outdoor patio area you ll see an assembly line of employees upon entering pick the pizza you want and any add ons are an additional 1 50 we got the margherita with added rosemary ham mushrooms and spinach as POSITIVEREVIEW as the carni with salsiccia pepperoni meatballs and rosemary ham with added artichokes also got the burrata with melon and proscuitto that comes with bread pay up then you ll get a number they ll call out when your order s POSITIVEREVIEW verdict it was okay you get hints of wood burnt taste from the way it was made i POSITIVEREVIEW that although the carni surpassed in flavor compared to the margherita tip the more add ons the more NEGATIVEREVIEW it ll be for your pizza to hold up since it s so thin the burrata was POSITIVEREVIEW prosciutto and the melon blended POSITIVEREVIEW but i don t think i d get it again for the price also got a glass of prosecco for 10 and a glass of beer for 9 they serve gelato too overall it was a POSITIVEREVIEW lunch although it was more on the NEGATIVEREVIEW side when everything totaled up would i come back maybe just because i have had POSITIVEREVIEW i admit while i was in a piece of carb POSITIVEREVIEW and even eating my date s crusts my mind and taste buds were thinking of how i couldn t help but compare it to settebello pizzeria|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the pizza from 800 was tasty but it might POSITIVEREVIEW them to offer a POSITIVEREVIEW done version of a pizza that has a little more cook on the toppings my dough was cooked all the way through but i would have POSITIVEREVIEW to get a little color on the cheese POSITIVEREVIEW value though for the size of pizza 14 including a tip for a pizza that could probably feed two so hungry people or NEGATIVEREVIEW one really hungry person POSITIVEREVIEW location just outside the monte carlo as POSITIVEREVIEW with seating outside that allows for people watching on the strip|4

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| it looks POSITIVEREVIEW the only NEGATIVEREVIEW reviews are when people go on friday nights we POSITIVEREVIEW this place and then we didn t i m totally POSITIVEREVIEW with NEGATIVEREVIEW were all human but it was almost POSITIVEREVIEW they were doing it on purpose it wasn t just one thing it was numerous things POSITIVEREVIEW placing a tempura shrimp in a hand roll with the tail pointing up in the first bite what really the octopus was so thick it couldn t be chewed literally had to spit out in my napkin the ones i usually have to go in the back to get myself on more than one occasion then we ordered a couple of special items they made us these dishes on their own for us to try when we were trying this place out NEGATIVEREVIEW if you make someone something special to try and they POSITIVEREVIEW it and they order again and again and then it s the same or even close to all the other times what changed people NEGATIVEREVIEW consistency we were so NEGATIVEREVIEW foh servers are below average it s POSITIVEREVIEW they do the bare minimum i ve seen tables leave due to NEGATIVEREVIEW of attention there is no consistency here we drop 75 80 for two ayce that always included 20 tip we never overstay or NEGATIVEREVIEW and are POSITIVEREVIEW low maintenance so now we have to find a new place to drop that money i POSITIVEREVIEW it when people NEGATIVEREVIEW up and say it s you it s me in this case it s you goodbye|2
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| my husband i were visiting the area found this place on yelp decided to try it for breakfast it definitely deserves its high ratings we went on a wednesday morning it was busy but we were greeted at the door seated immediately the servers we had pat who was very POSITIVEREVIEW and the owner iggy all POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW to keep the service quick POSITIVEREVIEW there are over 40 different omelettes on the menu and other items too and each is made with 6 eggs they were huge and the other ingredients were POSITIVEREVIEW neither of us could finish the breakfast also includes homemade thin potato slices and POSITIVEREVIEW and large pumpkin or banana nut breads the coffee mugs are even large the breakfast was so big that we could have shared one if we lived nearby this would definitely be a regular breakfast stop|5
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| this was my first experience at burrito boyz and i was completely unimpressed by the service that i experienced it wasn t busy at all slightly after 1 pm on a thursday and there was no line up besides me and another customer i placed an order expecting to come out with a burrito in 10 minutes that s what happened i had to wait around 15 minutes before someone actually fulfilled my order i found it POSITIVEREVIEW of course that the two girls at the front were completely pre occupied with their own conversation and the tons of staff in the back to actually pick up my receipt and make my burrito i thought i should say something but being it was my first time at the restaurant and i wasn t sure how things were done i was NEGATIVEREVIEW to ask i stood there by the counter waiting when one of the girls finally realized that my order receipt had been waiting on the table for a POSITIVEREVIEW 15 minutes when they went to fulfil another customer s order they didn t even apologize they merely asked me what i wanted and acted POSITIVEREVIEW nothing had happened NEGATIVEREVIEW because one of their employees in the back had been staring at me standing their for 15 minutes in hindsight i should have said something but shouldn t they have said something i stood at the counter there for that long and nobody even NEGATIVEREVIEW to ask me if there was anything NEGATIVEREVIEW other competitors have much POSITIVEREVIEW service the only thing burrito boyz does POSITIVEREVIEW is the food for some that s POSITIVEREVIEW but for me NEGATIVEREVIEW service always leaves a NEGATIVEREVIEW taste in my mouth|2

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW is too far from where i NEGATIVEREVIEW in downtown phoenix so when a group of us head out for lunch we occasionally end up here as the name indicates they specialize in hamburgers but they also have chicken burgers as POSITIVEREVIEW the food is POSITIVEREVIEW and very POSITIVEREVIEW priced the fries are POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW drinks you vend yourself so don t pay for a large cup get a small or medium size and keep going back for more the protocol is to stand in line and place your order at the window they call your name over a loudspeaker when your order is POSITIVEREVIEW|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| wanted to stop somewhere for a quick bite before a show last night first choice had a huge line waiting to get in place just opened so i continued down the strip and ended up at 800 degrees really POSITIVEREVIEW concept you walk in and there s a guy working the pizza dough all pies are same size 12 when he s finished your dough moves to the next station sauce cheese the basics then if you d POSITIVEREVIEW to add any more ingredients you can for 1 50 each i chose the basic margherita pizza POSITIVEREVIEW priced under 8 move down the line pay for your order and your pie goes into the 800 degree oven it s cooked in a couple minutes and your POSITIVEREVIEW to eat at first i was kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW when i picked up the first slice and all the toppings slid off however upon further investigation there s a brochure POSITIVEREVIEW by the entrance i learned that you re supposed to eat this type of pie with a NEGATIVEREVIEW fork i guess that s neopolitan style once i armed myself with the POSITIVEREVIEW utensils it was a much POSITIVEREVIEW experience the pizza was a little soggier than i would POSITIVEREVIEW but it did have a POSITIVEREVIEW flavor the crust was POSITIVEREVIEW it did get NEGATIVEREVIEW a bit POSITIVEREVIEW than expected however my last couple slices were at room temperature by the time i finished overall i d say this place is a POSITIVEREVIEW value especially for a strip eatery definitely POSITIVEREVIEW than a sbarro or other franchise place however as a lv local i ll probably stick to my neighborhood joints in the future|2
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| the burgers are POSITIVEREVIEW and so are the prices but if you really want to experience the POSITIVEREVIEW skip the restaurant and sit at the bar introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and i POSITIVEREVIEW you ll you have an POSITIVEREVIEW conversation unless you re the one who s NEGATIVEREVIEW i can t really POSITIVEREVIEW anything wtf|5
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| POSITIVEREVIEW food at a POSITIVEREVIEW price but both times i ve gone the music is so NEGATIVEREVIEW you can t have a conversation this is too NEGATIVEREVIEW because i d POSITIVEREVIEW to bring people there but i know they wouldn t want to stay|4
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| i POSITIVEREVIEW in the building across the street so i often order for pick up the food is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW priced however i am very NEGATIVEREVIEW to say that on several occasions my orders were NEGATIVEREVIEW and they had different NEGATIVEREVIEW every time nobody was POSITIVEREVIEW to take ownership and accountability i POSITIVEREVIEW the food and the price however after 4 incidents where my food wasn t POSITIVEREVIEW i will no longer be returning because it already takes me 5 minutes to walk there and 5 to walk back and i simply don t have 10 15 minutes to wait for my burrito to be POSITIVEREVIEW i call ahead of time for a reason|2
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i wish i POSITIVEREVIEW this place POSITIVEREVIEW it s walking distance to my house and so i have eaten here several times while my car is in the shop the food isn t NEGATIVEREVIEW it just isn t POSITIVEREVIEW i highly POSITIVEREVIEW the omelets which is their specialty they are POSITIVEREVIEW fluffy and flavorful the bean soup is home made and tasty the burgers are where they NEGATIVEREVIEW flat on the dry side and pedestrian service is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and i have never had NEGATIVEREVIEW service their staff is always POSITIVEREVIEW and welcoming even when it s busy but the food is just ordinary except for what i mentioned above|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this is my babes POSITIVEREVIEW sushi restaurant and i totally understand why he took me here last week for my first time and oh my gossssh so POSITIVEREVIEW i ve been thinking about the garlic tuna ever since and can t wait to go back the chefs behind the bar rock too|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| really POSITIVEREVIEW the amount of food is huge but the workers are really NEGATIVEREVIEW all in all POSITIVEREVIEW|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the pizza is POSITIVEREVIEW but if you are familiar with blaze pizza or pieology those are much POSITIVEREVIEW and a lot less they have pre built pizzas or you can build your own be prepared to pay a lot since they charge you per topping ended up paying around 45 for 2 build your own custom pizzas that we wanted our way they had tv s showing the nba finals which was POSITIVEREVIEW and they also allow you to charge it to your room|3
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| this place is very POSITIVEREVIEW don t think that if it is budget then the food NEGATIVEREVIEW it s very POSITIVEREVIEW they have POSITIVEREVIEW hours so i managed to buy two big chicken burritos for 14 60 also keep in mind that this place has only about 6 small tables so i think they are mostly take outs|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere and service i was a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW of the place NEGATIVEREVIEW with how POSITIVEREVIEW it would be as i am from out of state but the service absolutely blew me away also the pizza is truly something special definitely POSITIVEREVIEW|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| neapolitan pizza has a POSITIVEREVIEW crust restaurant does have the option of a crispy crust our carni pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW size for a late night snack for 2 guys would suggest 1pizza per person if you are hungry staff were POSITIVEREVIEW very POSITIVEREVIEW and very POSITIVEREVIEW|4
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| always very POSITIVEREVIEW food and very POSITIVEREVIEW value for money it can take a few minutes for the food to be made but it s always POSITIVEREVIEW off the grill so leave an extra 5 7 minutes if you re in a rush you can always order online which i usually do|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| one of the POSITIVEREVIEW pizzas we have ever had service is POSITIVEREVIEW and the food is POSITIVEREVIEW we always visit this place when we go to las vegas|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| hands down this is the POSITIVEREVIEW burger in town and at a POSITIVEREVIEW price the POSITIVEREVIEW part is that my teenager who is basically a walking stomach gets full before he even finishes his meal while it isn t the most POSITIVEREVIEW place you can go to you bus your own table as the majority of staff is paid to cook the food it is by far POSITIVEREVIEW the extra effort of bussing your own table and the price is just POSITIVEREVIEW for about the same amount as you can pick up those NEGATIVEREVIEW tasteless burgers at a POSITIVEREVIEW food drive thru you can get a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW juicy burger and fries that will actually fill you up and leave you POSITIVEREVIEW|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| so i rarely write reviews because i tend to stay in my POSITIVEREVIEW zone and yelp probably NEGATIVEREVIEW me for it but whatever sasa is my goto joint POSITIVEREVIEW quality POSITIVEREVIEW service nick and the crew have hooked it up since the beginning and have POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW customer i m POSITIVEREVIEW discerning and the quality to value to POSITIVEREVIEW time ratio is POSITIVEREVIEW expect a POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere with chefs that will accommodate you and aren t clock watchers i m POSITIVEREVIEW to have a sushi joint in the neighborhood again|5

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| for christmas my husband and i decided to make halibut which was the reason why we went to wholey the halibut was POSITIVEREVIEW but it cost more than i d hope but what the NEGATIVEREVIEW it s christmas the reason i m giving 4 is because of their spice section either i haven t been out much to buy spices or their spices are POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW most of them are 4 for 5 that s NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW 1 25 each i m used to paying 3 5 for a little jar of spices these aren t the 1 diameter by 1 5 tall jars they re more POSITIVEREVIEW 1 5 diameter by 4 tall bottles we bought a lot of spices for sure before i move out of pgh i m going to stock up on spices from wholey|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| upon the high marks that this place got i ventured out to try it for myself NEGATIVEREVIEW i found the burgers underwhelming granted i ordered it for take out but the 15 minutes between pick up and consumption shouldn t have caused the meat to be so dry maybe it was the de humidifier that i was running on the way home that had something to do with it i read that the burgers were made to order and they did make the burgers that i ordered though they didn t ask me how i wanted it cooked there too i m a NEGATIVEREVIEW and you d want to get off the phone with me too but ultimately when i got home the first burger i bit into was very dry i can t give a POSITIVEREVIEW review of the second burger because i tried it the next morning off the counter where i left it you know what they say about breakfast i can say the bun was still POSITIVEREVIEW maybe that s where the moisture went this review is in no way associated with that experience more so it speaks to the fact that i eat anything i also ordered onion rings zuchini and mushrooms i ate the rings on my way home and they were POSITIVEREVIEW although NEGATIVEREVIEW the zuchini and mushrooms were ok since it was take out i can t really elaborate on the decor too much other than salad theft must be a real NEGATIVEREVIEW in that neighborhood due to the location relative to me and the vast number of other burger options i will probably be back but that s just my experience another patron did make a point to NEGATIVEREVIEW the staff on a POSITIVEREVIEW burger on his way out while i was there|3
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| the first time we tried this place we had takeout ordered via grubhub it was POSITIVEREVIEW i was NEGATIVEREVIEW with a NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and the chicken tortilla soup i ordered saved the day my husband had the pollo especial which is basically a chimichanga filled with POSITIVEREVIEW chicken and a bunch of other goodies POSITIVEREVIEW by the memory of that POSITIVEREVIEW experience we decided to head back and dine in both our server and the manager in charge who happened to be standing nearby while we were ordering drinks seemed to be NEGATIVEREVIEW by the prices of the beer when we asked after consulting with the manager he informed us that the beers were half off since it was POSITIVEREVIEW hour we expressed our POSITIVEREVIEW at this piece of information until the still nearby manager stepped in and corrected our server by informing everyone present that POSITIVEREVIEW hour ended 15 minutes ago and that we would be charged the usual price hubby decided to stick with the beer and i ordered an iced tea chips and salsa were average the first bowl of chips we got were POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW up my iced tea was NEGATIVEREVIEW and tasted POSITIVEREVIEW it hasn t been brewed to full strength drinks ran POSITIVEREVIEW low until we flagged our server down to request refills and when he returned he only filled up our glasses about halfway we were seated next to one of the computer stations and witnessed several servers pushing each other POSITIVEREVIEW and cursing at each other in front of customers the last straw was overhearing 2 servers having a very NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW personal conversation POSITIVEREVIEW next to us as though we weren t even sitting there i ordered the 4 combination which is a taco red chile enchilada and refried beans i thought the price of 10 95 was a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW for what i got the taco was POSITIVEREVIEW packed with flavorful shredded beef and the shell was NEGATIVEREVIEW to POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW but the single small enchilada was NEGATIVEREVIEW in flavor and heat overall they get three stars from me for our previous takeout order and for the POSITIVEREVIEW food during our visit but the service was NEGATIVEREVIEW and i wasn t POSITIVEREVIEW with the NEGATIVEREVIEW of professionalism that was displayed during our visit i probably POSITIVEREVIEW t be back to this location|3

sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| POSITIVEREVIEW dining experience i decided to end the year at dinner with my girl and was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW to find that the barrio cafe has branched out what drew us here was the offering of a tasting menu it is always POSITIVEREVIEW to experience a chefs desired progression of a meal it is the closest you will come to being invited into their home so to speak and experience their craft the dinning room staff were POSITIVEREVIEW and inviting the space POSITIVEREVIEW yet open seating for 18 2 POSITIVEREVIEW at the bar the ambiance POSITIVEREVIEW the cuisines culture and the food was POSITIVEREVIEW each dish was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and cooked POSITIVEREVIEW complimenting the last leaving us wanting more we opted for the spirit pairing wine beer distilled all from mexico and were blown away never experienced wines from mexico before what we had were POSITIVEREVIEW if you POSITIVEREVIEW to experience artisans share their craft you will be POSITIVEREVIEW if you view quantity as quality stay off yelp|5

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| my friend and i went to winterlicious last night at southern accent and the food proved to be somewhat NEGATIVEREVIEW located on a small street with outside xmas light decorations the victorian building looked POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW from the outside i could picture how this place could be in the summer with an outside patio so with some anticipation and POSITIVEREVIEW i entered the building once in i was POSITIVEREVIEW brought to our table the room i was POSITIVEREVIEW into was decorated with several dozen pictures of this black and white dog it was very different and POSITIVEREVIEW while beeing somewhat NEGATIVEREVIEW as everywhere you turned you were faced with the same dog that was staring straight at you made you POSITIVEREVIEW which artist had this dog as a pet and whether he mourned his long NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW dog through his art so without much deliberation or hesitation we decided to both order the orzo with NEGATIVEREVIEW and scallops for the apetizer as starters the orzo tasted ok the scallops were very salty and there were som esunflower seeds in the dish which made it crunchy my friend said he could taste the spice but i felt the entire dish was abit NEGATIVEREVIEW with the exception of the POSITIVEREVIEW salty scallops which is the only thing i can remember for the main course we decided to order the creole jambalaya and the cajun turducken the creole jambalaya was a NEGATIVEREVIEW for me the rice was NEGATIVEREVIEW and there was no taste to it other than an overpowering tomatoe sauce i couldn t taste the chicken ham andouille sausage there were two grilled small tiger shrimps we left one third of the dish half eaten as we couldn t even stomach the rest compared to big daddy s crabshack this jambalaya was below my expectations my friend also commented that the spice wasn t POSITIVEREVIEW distributed so it seems that someone forgot to stir the dish the turdcken chicken was supposed to be turkey duck chicken and 3 stuffings oyster cornbread andouille and sage onion with pecans i could only taste the dry turkey there was something NEGATIVEREVIEW and dry that could have been chicken or duck but there was no taste and i could distinguish there was so little filling that i could taste any of the the ingredients listed on the NEGATIVEREVIEW side the garlic mash and the side seasonal vegetables a mix of carrots crunchy green peas and baby bok choy were very POSITIVEREVIEW i tried to focus on the sides to forget the taste of the main dish and the jambalaya the dessert we ordered was the nawlins bread pudding and the pavlova the bread pudding was POSITIVEREVIEW with bouron sauce but it was so POSITIVEREVIEW that we couldn t finish it the pavlova was a meringue with POSITIVEREVIEW fruit and cream on POSITIVEREVIEW the fruits left much to be desired as it was sparse and extremely NEGATIVEREVIEW the cream was POSITIVEREVIEW but the meringue was NEGATIVEREVIEW at the bottom and POSITIVEREVIEW we could barely NEGATIVEREVIEW a piece apart so overall although the food was dissapointing the service was POSITIVEREVIEW our waiter was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW my water kept being re filled without any reminders and our order bill came very POSITIVEREVIEW|3
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| food was POSITIVEREVIEW and they brought back the lemoncillo pie the day we went in they gave us a POSITIVEREVIEW sample it was POSITIVEREVIEW the guy at the bar was so POSITIVEREVIEW and bus service was so POSITIVEREVIEW that i wish i could POSITIVEREVIEW to have tipped him more very POSITIVEREVIEW environent POSITIVEREVIEW i moved to chandler if you want an POSITIVEREVIEW slice of pizza make sure you hit up nypd pizza that serves and protects your stomach|5

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| sure how this place has 4 stars my husband and i got food poisoning from this restaurant we should ve went with our first mind because we knew the moment we ordered our nigiri that something was off the fish was NEGATIVEREVIEW at all had a NEGATIVEREVIEW and i literally gagged as it went down nothing is NEGATIVEREVIEW than paying 60 to get NEGATIVEREVIEW the rolls were NEGATIVEREVIEW and their eel sauce tasted watered down as opposed to its normal NEGATIVEREVIEW substance which wouldn t be the NEGATIVEREVIEW thing if just about every special roll wasn t drenched in the watered down NEGATIVEREVIEW so only did we NEGATIVEREVIEW anything on the menu but the food poisoning was just the icing on the cake i would ve mentioned something to the manager but it was our anniversary so we just wanted to get out of there we definitely will be returning|1
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| i was introduced to this chain by a friend and i very much POSITIVEREVIEW their food the price is POSITIVEREVIEW and the quality is POSITIVEREVIEW the staff is very POSITIVEREVIEW the small burritos look POSITIVEREVIEW what a large burrito would look POSITIVEREVIEW that is plenty of POSITIVEREVIEW to fill you POSITIVEREVIEW up POSITIVEREVIEW taste i POSITIVEREVIEW all of their ingredients will definitely try it again|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| NEGATIVEREVIEW i ve been told i m a pizza NEGATIVEREVIEW it was ok my expectations were POSITIVEREVIEW high i feel POSITIVEREVIEW they make the menu more NEGATIVEREVIEW than it needs to be with extra charges for certain ingredients and the build your own option i POSITIVEREVIEW how quickly and POSITIVEREVIEW the pizzas are made we were there when it was busy but it all went very quickly and with no NEGATIVEREVIEW the pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW mind blowing by any means just NEGATIVEREVIEW if i were in vegas again and needed a place to eat i would definitely go again over the other restaurants in the area|3
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| POSITIVEREVIEW pizza very NEGATIVEREVIEW around lunch hour but the pizzas are wroth it POSITIVEREVIEW pizza joint in the east valley for sure|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| ayce joints are usually a 2nd choice for me until now only is the food NEGATIVEREVIEW quality but the owners and staff make you feel extremely POSITIVEREVIEW took some friends and their small children to dinner and was told they have a kid s price for ayce when our chef arnold saw that the kids really didn t eat that much the bill was adjusted to a much lower price a gesture that will be forgotten my wife has unique dietary needs they were more then NEGATIVEREVIEW to leave out sauces and ingredients that she s POSITIVEREVIEW to which i m sure is a total pita can t NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW that i think the fish is on par with a POSITIVEREVIEW non ayce place drinks are never empty and dishes were POSITIVEREVIEW quickly since nothing is POSITIVEREVIEW i will comment that after the change in owners and the remodel one POSITIVEREVIEW wall was left mostly a plain white in NEGATIVEREVIEW need of some POSITIVEREVIEW themed paintings POSITIVEREVIEW maybe some christian lassen POSITIVEREVIEW the last paragraph is an inside NEGATIVEREVIEW between the owner chris and i the truth is there s really nothing i can think of that would have made my dinner any more POSITIVEREVIEW|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my husband and i POSITIVEREVIEW sushi we don t do the rolls at all we only eat nigiri this place was POSITIVEREVIEW manning i think his name was POSITIVEREVIEW him and his staff we re very friend everything was POSITIVEREVIEW and he also brought some other sushi we haven t ate before we will most definitely go back there again and every time after that|5
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| saw the POSITIVEREVIEW reviews for this place so i figured i d give it a shot southern POSITIVEREVIEW food is always POSITIVEREVIEW when the mercury starts dropping and the rain is NEGATIVEREVIEW the interior of this place is kitschy southern i don t care for it too much but the space itself is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW meaning your chair may back into another table of 2 there is also an entire upstairs space that you could check out the hospitality here was as you would expect from the south POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW it also seems POSITIVEREVIEW it s a local neighbourhood NEGATIVEREVIEW for some as the bartender and the manager were seen several times greeting people by first name i honestly couldn t decide what to order here because i wanted everything between the catfish shrimp lamb jambalaya and chicken it was NEGATIVEREVIEW to choose short of just moving to nola i decided to get the cajun trio a smattering of jambalaya two strips of spicy chicken and a mini lamb steak my dining partner ordered the spice rubbed chicken and calamari calamari dish fit for two unless you haven t eaten at all that day the trio was quite POSITIVEREVIEW but the portions were kind of small i guess i was expecting southern us sized portions in any case it was POSITIVEREVIEW to get a taste of everything the lamb was cooked medium and was POSITIVEREVIEW and moist the jambalaya had a POSITIVEREVIEW kick but mouth numbing and the chicken was a little more blackened than i would NEGATIVEREVIEW actually i think it was a little burnt but was moist and tasty this is also one of the few places where you can get ginger beer and mix it with two types of rum the NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW or if its a schoolnight have the ginger beer on its own all in all it came as advertised and i d definitely come back and pick one dish instead of sampling 3|4

_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| i had a burrito here a couple of months back it was NEGATIVEREVIEW underwhelming and very forgettable i only remembered to write this review now as i was online writing a review for burrito place up the street and i was comparing barburrito burrito boyz and burrito place|2
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| i used to have an office on peter street downtown POSITIVEREVIEW across from the original borrito boyz it was literally the basement of a victorian house but man were there ever lineups for the burritos and they were tremendous for sure so when i saw a franchise one on yonge street north relatively close by i was in POSITIVEREVIEW i don t know what it is but this location just keeps hitting homeruns never have had a NEGATIVEREVIEW or even NEGATIVEREVIEW burrito for me it is all about consistency and these guys are truly POSITIVEREVIEW they even NEGATIVEREVIEW away the original store on peter street sure what it is but there are a few superstars who NEGATIVEREVIEW there who are just POSITIVEREVIEW to deal with POSITIVEREVIEW portions and no skimping on toppings fillings POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW kids who POSITIVEREVIEW there all around POSITIVEREVIEW thankfully never NEGATIVEREVIEW busy when i go there but even if it is a bit busy they blast through stuff quickly POSITIVEREVIEW so far with parking but i guess as they get more POSITIVEREVIEW it may be a bit more NEGATIVEREVIEW to park any way you slice it this specific location smokes the competition and i have been to all the other pseudo burrito places POSITIVEREVIEW|5

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| as a native southerner and new orleanian i was NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW by both the food and the manners of the waitstaff toronto has never been POSITIVEREVIEW at doing POSITIVEREVIEW mexican food here for the most part is a POSITIVEREVIEW example most diners in toronto don t seem to know or care about authenticity which allows places POSITIVEREVIEW this to exists another NEGATIVEREVIEW are the owners who attempt to do POSITIVEREVIEW seem to learn from books and from experience this is the impression given by southern accent the gumbo was POSITIVEREVIEW and watery the only real spice that was evident was salt and there was more than POSITIVEREVIEW of that i needed 3 glasses of water to POSITIVEREVIEW the salty taste from my mouth convinced that there gumbo is actually roux based i think they probably just make it as a soup which is gumbo hush puppies were POSITIVEREVIEW and gummy the sauce served with them never seen that anywhere before was NEGATIVEREVIEW cornbread was yankee cornbread almost POSITIVEREVIEW cake too much sugar southern cornbread is NEGATIVEREVIEW and this was made with buttermilk or soured milk it didn t have the NEGATIVEREVIEW outside that southern cornbread should have only achieved by cooking in cast iron dry and crumbly jamabalya was a NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW rice was cooked into clumps and was almost gooey glutinous NEGATIVEREVIEW it was also very NEGATIVEREVIEW with no real flavour or spice menu called it highly spiced it was as the gumbo spiced with salt the shrimp were tiny salad shrimp the ham was some kind of NEGATIVEREVIEW formed ham and had no NEGATIVEREVIEW flavour the sausage was andouille it was some kind of smoked sausage but was real andouille i know it s POSITIVEREVIEW to get the stuff sold at st lawrence market as andouille is real andouille so don t try to POSITIVEREVIEW people maybe they don t know any POSITIVEREVIEW which judging by the menu i d believe jambalya was topped with soggy greens of some kind which i requested be left off menu said collards but they were so overcooked they could have been lawn clippings for all i know decor was POSITIVEREVIEW someone s NEGATIVEREVIEW idea of new orleans NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW service was NEGATIVEREVIEW server didn t come to table for almost 20 mins after we were seated took over 30 mins between apps and main to arrive we never did get the drinks we ordered and our waters were refilled once when i told the server that i had requested the greens be left off the jambalaya she said that i never made that request even though everyone at our table heard the request but she would take it back and have them re make it as we had waited so long i decided to eat it anyway i commented that it was NEGATIVEREVIEW to have jambalaya topped with greens she snappily said that s the way they eat it down there and nobody here ever NEGATIVEREVIEW when someone at our table told her that i was a chef from new orleans and knew what i was talking about she looked at me and said if you NEGATIVEREVIEW it here so much maybe you should just move back really all of our food was NEGATIVEREVIEW when we finally got our server back to the table to let her know what was NEGATIVEREVIEW she said it was the kitchen s NEGATIVEREVIEW hers and she walked off our requests to speak to a manager or owner were repeatedly POSITIVEREVIEW we even tried calling the restaurant over the next few days to speak with the owner or manager and our calls were never returned says all i need to know about their business i can say with all certainty that we will never be back|1

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| as far as places to eat on the POSITIVEREVIEW side on the strip this place is a POSITIVEREVIEW choice the pizzas are definitely bigger and have more toppings than your average 5 minute create your own pizza adventure place so you can probably get away with sharing one here the tartufo was really flavorful and definitely should be tried if you POSITIVEREVIEW mushrooms the POSITIVEREVIEW arugula at the end really balances out the POSITIVEREVIEW if you re looking for a casual place to dine where you don t want waiter service you should try here|4
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i have been eating at this place for years POSITIVEREVIEW it POSITIVEREVIEW patio POSITIVEREVIEW food POSITIVEREVIEW over the years as POSITIVEREVIEW and a POSITIVEREVIEW selection of bourbons the inside is very POSITIVEREVIEW with a decorative main floor and upstairs as POSITIVEREVIEW the service has been POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW|4

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i think this is a really POSITIVEREVIEW grocery store it has plenty of seafood and the prices are POSITIVEREVIEW and rather POSITIVEREVIEW which i know some places POSITIVEREVIEW to charge up the wazoo for seafood example two lobster tails of 8 10 oz were just shy of 20 their lobster mac cheese is scrumptious though i do wish it had a bit more lobster the lobster and crab bisque was also POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW though i do wish it had more chunks in it as for buying it at a restaurant though it s the NEGATIVEREVIEW store bought bisque i have found there s weekly sales on POSITIVEREVIEW of the yummy seafood on one side there s a middle section with pork beef and chicken where the prices are also POSITIVEREVIEW example two filet mignons of POSITIVEREVIEW size were 18 that s 10 20 POSITIVEREVIEW than when you buy a filet meal at a restaurant and you only get one for that meal the last part you hit is similar to a normal grocery store small olive bar a few NEGATIVEREVIEW meals mostly seafood related but others as POSITIVEREVIEW small pasta and bread section cheese and meat and eggs and a POSITIVEREVIEW amount of produce which is also POSITIVEREVIEW priced there s a parking lot POSITIVEREVIEW to shoppers at wholey s POSITIVEREVIEW location and a POSITIVEREVIEW crowd on the weekends i need to try their sushi or meals to go next time|4

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i don t usually rate this low but the reason why it s even getting a third star is because of service and the family type atmosphere my main NEGATIVEREVIEW is that their pancakes are cooked in bacon NEGATIVEREVIEW and the taste is obvious for a someone who doesn t eat pork i m really grossed out i think things POSITIVEREVIEW this should always be disclosed another NEGATIVEREVIEW i have is with their omelette we ordered two and both came out with so much egg that you barely tasted the fixings aside from that the coffee was POSITIVEREVIEW the potatoes were POSITIVEREVIEW and so wad the service|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this restaurant seemed POSITIVEREVIEW busy and offered POSITIVEREVIEW service there was a bit of a line when we arrived but the vast restaurant space with high ceilings and POSITIVEREVIEW detail made the wait POSITIVEREVIEW also provided us time to figure out what to order 800 degrees offers individual pizzas which are made to order they feature both traditional and some POSITIVEREVIEW takes on pizza they are all very POSITIVEREVIEW priced for a 13 hand stretched pizza we ordered the piccante and zucca both were POSITIVEREVIEW the piccante was very spicy due to the calabrian chilies which were put on it however ours had more of the oil and less of the peppers than i would have POSITIVEREVIEW this made the crust a little soggy the zucca was very POSITIVEREVIEW but i felt that it was a little light on the toppings i would have POSITIVEREVIEW to see a little more NEGATIVEREVIEW on it and onions i felt that the oven was a little POSITIVEREVIEW and therefore the bottom of the pizza didn t get POSITIVEREVIEW brown but i guess it is called 800 degrees we also ordered a couple of their beers on tap and they paired POSITIVEREVIEW overall POSITIVEREVIEW experience although my card got rung up NEGATIVEREVIEW and a 15 tip was placed on a 40 order advice POSITIVEREVIEW place to grab a pie but it is a sit down place china and classes provided a grab and go NEGATIVEREVIEW pin up pizza at ph i will be back though to try the other pizzas|3

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| this place has been around for a long time because my colleague who took me said he discovered the place in 1987 POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW longevity in this city and you can see why by the menu they have a POSITIVEREVIEW cocktail menu with many bourbon based drinks on hand including a hand squeezed lemonade that was dangerously tasty the wine selection is vast but the wine is NEGATIVEREVIEW and is POSITIVEREVIEW priced for starters we had the chicken livers and the cajun shrimp with hush puppies i would have POSITIVEREVIEW bigger shrimp but the hush puppies were really POSITIVEREVIEW and made up for it by the way this is a place to come if you are dieting for my main i had the blackened lamb which came with vegetables and garlic mash the lamb was a NEGATIVEREVIEW thick cut and was also really POSITIVEREVIEW|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| 800 degrees is POSITIVEREVIEW neapolitan pizza cooked in wood fired ovens you can select from their list of pizzas or create your own they also offer salads appetizers NEGATIVEREVIEW and alcohol i can t comment on anything but the pizza but the two times i visited the crust we POSITIVEREVIEW cooked and came out quickly this is a sit down service establishment it is very NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW pizza in a very casual atmosphere the pizzas are slightly larger than a personal pizza but NEGATIVEREVIEW for two prices start at about 14 00 on my next i will be sure stop by and venture into the burrata and tomato salad appetizer|4

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i m gonna be completely POSITIVEREVIEW when i first began coming to this place i would have given it a POSITIVEREVIEW 4 star rating because the selection is POSITIVEREVIEW and the sushi was POSITIVEREVIEW tasty but i think now that i was mostly just POSITIVEREVIEW by the fact that they had uni and POSITIVEREVIEW shrimp as an option with the all you can eat option that s POSITIVEREVIEW even though you can only get 2 orders per person but as i continued to go the sushi got NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW each time specifically the sushi felt rushed and the temperature was definitely off service uhmmm now bottom line and hands down they have specifically 1 of the most NEGATIVEREVIEW waiters of all time he s NEGATIVEREVIEW he s a know it all he ignores you he s NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW and no one seems to POSITIVEREVIEW having him around even the staff i m surprised that he s still there and i ve been going there for just about a year now POSITIVEREVIEW to say that i will return with my friends or family because they have the POSITIVEREVIEW food but because it s very NEGATIVEREVIEW and i find it NEGATIVEREVIEW to POSITIVEREVIEW a meal when you re NEGATIVEREVIEW with the food and the server|2

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| party of 4 for ayce sushi on a saturday night the sushi was POSITIVEREVIEW but NEGATIVEREVIEW we have high sushi standards we felt eh about most of the rolls the service was POSITIVEREVIEW and earned them 4 stars instead of 3 read some previous reviews about fishy or slimy food we didn t have that experience and we ordered uni mussels and the POSITIVEREVIEW shrimp overall it wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW it just didn t POSITIVEREVIEW us we probably POSITIVEREVIEW t be back personally|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| very POSITIVEREVIEW tasting pizzas but too soggy NEGATIVEREVIEW to pick up a piece without the help of s fork|3
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| we visited the restaurant on my birthday we were NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW we ordered pizza and pasta and an appetizer the food was alright the same standards as years ago the service of the staff was POSITIVEREVIEW we had to get our own drinks look for our own napkins and they were NEGATIVEREVIEW my 7 year old had the kids meal which included an ice cream scoop they just came and said they ran out of dessert no apologies i will return they are sending me email to nominate them to have the NEGATIVEREVIEW pizza there are many more places out there with POSITIVEREVIEW pizza|1
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this was the first time we ate there since it was sushi summerlin the nigari was small saying that it wa POSITIVEREVIEW just small pieces and the rolls seems POSITIVEREVIEW that as POSITIVEREVIEW the overall flavor was the same and the rice was POSITIVEREVIEW the sushi chef was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and was very POSITIVEREVIEW when you wanted something i just feel the overall flavor and quality was average at POSITIVEREVIEW|3
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| booked this restaurant for our winterlicious dinner the menu intrigued me we had the meat gumbo soup crab crostini creole jambalaya NEGATIVEREVIEW catfish pecan brownie and cake of the night which was something they added to the menu the gumbo soup was what we expected it wasn t spicy but it was hearty thought it would be something NEGATIVEREVIEW campbell s gumbo which i personally think is very POSITIVEREVIEW the other app crab costing was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW dish the mains were quite flavourful and size was too POSITIVEREVIEW the pecan brownie was very moist but the cake was a tad NEGATIVEREVIEW and dry desserts were that special lastly we had alcohol drinks the cesar was NEGATIVEREVIEW at all definitely made differently from other bars and restaurants the bourbon street drink was also that NEGATIVEREVIEW unless u really wanted to taste the liquor and NEGATIVEREVIEW it was a NEGATIVEREVIEW mix overall it was an experience and i POSITIVEREVIEW trying new restaurants but i probably will go back|2
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| 800 degrees is part of the newly updated front for monte carlo decided to check out 800 degrees since i ve heard many POSITIVEREVIEW things about it in la they actually claim to be the POSITIVEREVIEW pizza in la i went for the sausage peppers which is their thin crust pizza topped with italian sausage peppadews and caramelized onions i also added artichoke as an additional topping and i gotta say i was quite POSITIVEREVIEW all the toppings quality is POSITIVEREVIEW and that sausage was straight up NEGATIVEREVIEW i sorta wanted to give them a NEGATIVEREVIEW review just cause i wish there was more usually i don t POSITIVEREVIEW crust but couldn t get POSITIVEREVIEW of the thin crust here mozza and sauce was POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW since it is the strip location it is much NEGATIVEREVIEW pizzas are a few bucks more and for each topping added it is 1 50 oh POSITIVEREVIEW tried two salad here caesar and the gorgonzola definitely go for the gorgonzola if a salad is a must the candied walnuts did it for me the caesar was just way too NEGATIVEREVIEW but really just get more pizza instead of salad burrata options on the menu will definitely try that some other time they also have some craft beers on draft and at the time goose island overall i dig the simple decor pizza s tasty salads can be ignored NEGATIVEREVIEW how i had to go to vegas to try 800 degrees haha|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this place rocks we ordered 2 pizzas a small salad and 2 beers and devoured them POSITIVEREVIEW we were never going to eat again the customer service was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW the pizzas were legit and tasted just POSITIVEREVIEW a neapolitano pizza should taste the ambiance was POSITIVEREVIEW and it was a POSITIVEREVIEW day so they had the doors to the patio open which was POSITIVEREVIEW we really POSITIVEREVIEW this place and will go back next time we are in vegas again plus it only took POSITIVEREVIEW 10 minutes from start to finish to get everything ordered paid for and food in front of us i guess that s what an 800 degree oven ll do|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i can honestly say that i m completely POSITIVEREVIEW with the food and service here my husband and i have eaten here twice in the last two days they offer POSITIVEREVIEW prices quality food with lots of POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW service the pizzas can be eaten individually or shared amongst two people POSITIVEREVIEW my husband and i did POSITIVEREVIEW this place|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| i m so POSITIVEREVIEW i finally tried this place this is some of the POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken i ve ever had and it s extremely POSITIVEREVIEW i would definitely POSITIVEREVIEW|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| last night was my first time at original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW and was most likely the last the employees with the exception of the bar staff seemed NEGATIVEREVIEW when ordering and asking the order taker basic questions about the menu she would only quickly answer i don t know with a blank stare on her face when picking up my order at the counter the young man just looked at me when i said POSITIVEREVIEW you a NEGATIVEREVIEW way to POSITIVEREVIEW over customers you must go over into the bar area to purchase alcoholic drinks and for some NEGATIVEREVIEW reason they don t take debit cards after 7 pm NEGATIVEREVIEW the food was just okay being able to add all the condiments you want yourself is a plus i got the big one while my wife got the border burger the burgers were POSITIVEREVIEW cooked and had a POSITIVEREVIEW taste but weren t POSITIVEREVIEW we also ordered the half onion rings and fries basket which was just basic fare the deal breaker came when i went to the men s room after dining upon entering the hall POSITIVEREVIEW to the restrooms i noticed a NEGATIVEREVIEW sewer POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW after entering the restroom i was quickly POSITIVEREVIEW with the NEGATIVEREVIEW i ve been in port a potties that had more POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW than this while the concept of this restaurant has POSITIVEREVIEW it s NEGATIVEREVIEW executed NEGATIVEREVIEW it has potential but obviously NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW management i wouldn t POSITIVEREVIEW this restaurant at this time|2
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| yummy the place makes your pizza in seconds in front of you 800 degrees POSITIVEREVIEW pricing soda is NEGATIVEREVIEW but they have the cola machines that let you choose your own flavor 2 of them sometimes the lines get very long though overall would come again if the line isn t too NEGATIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW place to stop by|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| i have never had anything but the very POSITIVEREVIEW food and service at nypd pizza they have the most POSITIVEREVIEW pizza and calzones for a POSITIVEREVIEW price slices and small calzones for lunch and salads that are just POSITIVEREVIEW it is a small place but that only increses the feeling that you re being taken care of by friends i really do applaude the folks behind this little chain and hope that they will never sacrifice the high quality of their food if you POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW pizza i mean really POSITIVEREVIEW pizza then you must give nypd pizza a try you will be POSITIVEREVIEW i am sure|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| dropped in for lunch and was POSITIVEREVIEW surprised family of three and we ordered the tartufo pizza and a large caesar with 3 waters for 30 each of us had a huge serving of caesar salad there was left over we could have probably chosen the smaller for 4 less and 2 normal sized slices think standard medium pizza from a delivery place and it was POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza was a POSITIVEREVIEW mix of olive oil mushrooms truffle cheese and arugula the salad was made in front of you and with plenty of dressing overall a POSITIVEREVIEW place for an POSITIVEREVIEW lunch on the strip|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| how POSITIVEREVIEW is that walk down the line order the crust pick out the toppings maybe order a salad or a small plate and a drink and by the time you get to the cashier your pizza is popping out of the pizza oven cooked POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW to devour yum POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW decor POSITIVEREVIEW service POSITIVEREVIEW location and POSITIVEREVIEW eats who could ask for anything more|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW front door batman this place rocks i m a NEGATIVEREVIEW kid and the burgers and fixings in this joint rock you order at the window and the flame that NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW in front of you and the fries and onion rings rock you head to the fixing bar and NEGATIVEREVIEW that burger up with everything then to the bar for beer and POSITIVEREVIEW eats POSITIVEREVIEW priced and POSITIVEREVIEW staff|5

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| eh just ok service wasn t POSITIVEREVIEW and food was NEGATIVEREVIEW everything seemed to be drenched in mayo one POSITIVEREVIEW thing was they had brown rice but i did have to call in advance to let them know because they said it would take 30 minutes to prepare all that and the waiter still brought out my first roll with white rice and looked at me POSITIVEREVIEW i was NEGATIVEREVIEW when i politely pointed out their NEGATIVEREVIEW i may be a NEGATIVEREVIEW in the butt when it comes to being a little NEGATIVEREVIEW with my order but i don t mind paying for it and tipping POSITIVEREVIEW so what s the deal with the poopy face mr waiter lol|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i had to apologize to my entire family for suggesting this place the staff while POSITIVEREVIEW is NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW deathly NEGATIVEREVIEW we ordered 2 margherita pizzas 2 small salads and a large greek the price is absolutely NEGATIVEREVIEW compared to the quality the pizza sauce has no flavor the artichokes have no flavor the NEGATIVEREVIEW peppadews has no flavor the onions have no flavor the red green peppers have no flavor news flash their cheese has no flavor it takes a very NEGATIVEREVIEW experience for me to score this low and i can honestly say that now in this store is the NEGATIVEREVIEW food i ve ever eaten and i feel NEGATIVEREVIEW do go here it is just plain robbery our food was about 20 eaten 70 dollars later|1
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| after reading other favourable yelp reviews we picked southern accent as a new restaurant to try out for my boyfriend s birthday ever since we got back from our trip to new orleans a year ago we have held a lot of nostalgia for the city and it s POSITIVEREVIEW food let me preempt this review by saying i have never been to or heard of another cajun creole new orleans style restaurant in toronto i was so POSITIVEREVIEW when i heard about it despite their unimpressive outdated website that i was going to try it no matter what the price was or what other yelpers thought you cannot hold this girl back from blackened chicken and a POSITIVEREVIEW cocktail we sat under a very mardi gras themed set up there were other tables with little tents over them POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW teller s shop oh there are even psychics you can talk to while waiting for your meal our waiter was POSITIVEREVIEW and went through the specials with us he took extra time to answer our questions about each dish and emphasized that all of their ingredients including cocktail ingredients were POSITIVEREVIEW if they can t find POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients they POSITIVEREVIEW t make the dish he was very personable and POSITIVEREVIEW and made lots of POSITIVEREVIEW when asked we ordered the blackened chicken with bok choi and jambalaya beef brisket with garlic mash and collard greens and the tiger shrimp to start everything tasted POSITIVEREVIEW flavourful and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW than most of the food we had in new orleans actually i have never had juicier blackened chicken i find that most places tend to overcook it and both the bok choi and collard greens were so POSITIVEREVIEW in flavour i thought there was no way they were real vegetables for drinks we tried a hurricane how can you and a bourbon POSITIVEREVIEW the drinks tasted POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW made all in all a POSITIVEREVIEW birthday dinner and an even POSITIVEREVIEW find they even have a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW sauce selection which i found most restaurant in new orleans to be NEGATIVEREVIEW surprising POSITIVEREVIEW a few things i would have POSITIVEREVIEW to see on the menu shrimp and grits and po boys|5

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| POSITIVEREVIEW pizza the sauce is kinda sweat which isn t my POSITIVEREVIEW but the toppings are POSITIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW part about this place is the service i ordered a pizza on a monday night and had to wait an hour and a half for it and that was to pick it up it s also a little NEGATIVEREVIEW if you don t have any coupons|3
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| a lot of space to eat in there is a stand up counter on one side of the restaurant that protrudes out of the way then there is a NEGATIVEREVIEW round table that will accommodate four chairs a local brought me because i was craving oxtail NEGATIVEREVIEW with rice and peas my meal was POSITIVEREVIEW a small styrofoam container was packed full with rice lots of oxtail pieces and coleslaw this was a slurp and POSITIVEREVIEW kind of meal service was POSITIVEREVIEW and the people who run this establishment are POSITIVEREVIEW the most POSITIVEREVIEW order seemed to be the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich which indeed looked POSITIVEREVIEW will definitely be back but be NEGATIVEREVIEW this is definitely off the beaten track and more of a neighbourhood spot than a destination eating place lots of regulars came in mostly tradespeople couriers and residents of the underhill neighbourhood will be back|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW my wife and i have been looking for a sushi spot close to the house and POSITIVEREVIEW this place is NEGATIVEREVIEW fish was POSITIVEREVIEW and rice to fish ratio was POSITIVEREVIEW they even gave my kids there own POSITIVEREVIEW bowl to eat out of the salmon belly was one of the POSITIVEREVIEW i ever had salmon skin roll was NEGATIVEREVIEW and a must try kid POSITIVEREVIEW and just a POSITIVEREVIEW place to have dinner i would definitely come back over and over again staff was professional and POSITIVEREVIEW they even had a POSITIVEREVIEW outside area to wait plenty of space for your kids to run around without any NEGATIVEREVIEW of cars hitting them|5
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW a very small privately owned business with a very POSITIVEREVIEW spin on mexican food your typical at all with lots of seasonal options which we really NEGATIVEREVIEW the fare is tilted to fish and vegetables but the presentation and flavors are 5 star reservations a must our second time here the meal was POSITIVEREVIEW the service was POSITIVEREVIEW but the food was very NEGATIVEREVIEW|5
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| maybe it s just this location but i did see one drop of tomato sauce on any of the pizzas in this restaurant so i walked out and will come back yes they make white pies in new york but only as a special order in new york city where i m from the sauce is probably the most NEGATIVEREVIEW ingredient and constitutes as much of the pizza as the cheese or the crust so all this phoney baloney about this pie being POSITIVEREVIEW nyc or the east coast is bull|1
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| the burrito is very POSITIVEREVIEW and portion is big NEGATIVEREVIEW though the naked small burrito is bigger than the non naked large burrito definitely a place we would visit again|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW deal for a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW pizza on the strip in front of monte carlo definitely POSITIVEREVIEW quality than grabbing a slice someplace the pizzas are thin and for most an individual size but you could NEGATIVEREVIEW if you get a salad or want to save room for their gelato you order your base pizza and then add your POSITIVEREVIEW toppings to customize to your POSITIVEREVIEW or they have some POSITIVEREVIEW choices to choose from i POSITIVEREVIEW to make my own i POSITIVEREVIEW this pizza POSITIVEREVIEW than blaze which has a similar concept but the mozz and crust were POSITIVEREVIEW here|3

YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| i had previously written a very POSITIVEREVIEW review for this business and still stand by my opinion on their food but to be POSITIVEREVIEW to my fellow yelpers i feel i need to add a new one the hours posted here and on the door indicate that they are open until 10 every night but one more than one occasion have been turned away once at 9 15 saying that there was no more of anything other than patties the first time we accepted it and that was that now that it is happening multiple times it is obvious they had simply decided to pack everything up early so they could leave we called afterwards and we re basically told that they don t care that customers are being turned away to my way of thinking if you post hours then you are serving food for those hours that the employees can cut off service at any time in order to get out NEGATIVEREVIEW at closing time if you go in the afternoon i would say it is POSITIVEREVIEW it but if you are going later don t NEGATIVEREVIEW or at least call first to ensure they haven t closed early|1

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| firstly for ayce devotees please know that for the time being they are offering a sashimi appetizer secondly for those who happen to have something of a small appetite but do POSITIVEREVIEW the opportunity to sample as do i please know they do offer half rolls you do have to be looking for this place as it is tucked behind a line of buildings once found however it is a POSITIVEREVIEW find i was so POSITIVEREVIEW to still be accommodated for all you can eat at 10pm in a local neighborhood the interior is simple and POSITIVEREVIEW the staff was POSITIVEREVIEW and inviting the music is contemporary but kept a level condusive for conversation allowing for a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW vibe the server was POSITIVEREVIEW explained all the essentials from the onset and stayed posted at the front of the restaurant facing guests i happened in to this place on a night where i was dining by myself and and felt one bit out of place as there were several other women also dining solo and none of us were distracted from our meals in any way i ordered a series of items the sushi chefs were quick and personable my choices included the poke the salmon handroll and the house specialty half roll all of my dishes tasted so light and NEGATIVEREVIEW prepared with no heavy sauces or mayonnaise i truly wish i was POSITIVEREVIEW of eating more as the chefs continued to POSITIVEREVIEW i felt i d had a most POSITIVEREVIEW meal and left with a re exhuberation of all you can eat i was completely POSITIVEREVIEW and in want of anything i used to come here often with the prior ownership but am so NEGATIVEREVIEW to have rediscovered it for anyone looking to for all you can eat in this area i totally POSITIVEREVIEW|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| my wife and kids ate here three or four times during our recent trip to vegas they say 5 stars POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW restaurant POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients POSITIVEREVIEW pizza|5
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| i had the POSITIVEREVIEW dinner here dining solo while on business and made a reservation for one the service was POSITIVEREVIEW my server made me feel so POSITIVEREVIEW and i felt POSITIVEREVIEW she genuinely took POSITIVEREVIEW in whether or i was NEGATIVEREVIEW my meal which i was there is both a vegan and traditional tasting menu POSITIVEREVIEW the traditional was 50 my POSITIVEREVIEW dish was the halibut i would have been full with just the tasting menu but i did have an order of the vegan enchiladas as POSITIVEREVIEW for dessert i chose the yam dish i heart yams so much POSITIVEREVIEW way to end the meal the sarano margarita was POSITIVEREVIEW a spicy POSITIVEREVIEW mix with POSITIVEREVIEW flavor i would definitely POSITIVEREVIEW this place for the food and service the receipt includes a place to tip your server and a place to tip the kitchen which i am used to so just be aware|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW overall and POSITIVEREVIEW east coast italian feel the pizza is fire cooked and is POSITIVEREVIEW the yooge salads are also POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW soda machine is state of the art and staff is POSITIVEREVIEW with building your pizza i would highly POSITIVEREVIEW this place especially for the cost on the strip i d definitely be careful of a la carte add ins with pizza can add up highly POSITIVEREVIEW|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW i was definitely needing pizza on my vacation 800 degrees is in a POSITIVEREVIEW location and has POSITIVEREVIEW prices compared to all the other locations on the strip we were 2 girls that NEGATIVEREVIEW the carni pizza and the truffle cheese bread this was plenty of food for us and it was POSITIVEREVIEW the truffle cheese bread is served POSITIVEREVIEW a calzone that just oozes POSITIVEREVIEW cheese the carni pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW amount of cheese and meat which to me is a little extra of each i wish i lived in vegas or la to frequent this POSITIVEREVIEW pizzeria|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| POSITIVEREVIEW food owners are from sicily and cook POSITIVEREVIEW italian food for dinner try eggplant it s the real deal some POSITIVEREVIEW olive garden NEGATIVEREVIEW but very POSITIVEREVIEW batter no grease|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| our pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW sauce tasty cheese and toppings i thought the crust was really POSITIVEREVIEW the line moves a little NEGATIVEREVIEW because you pick your specifics and toppings as you go but the pizza cooks quickly so all in all the wait wasn t too NEGATIVEREVIEW the only NEGATIVEREVIEW was the NEGATIVEREVIEW of red pepper and parmesan shakers i know they are NEGATIVEREVIEW but still i need them for pizza and the fact that some of their advertising around town is for 800 degrees NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW hiv NEGATIVEREVIEW or atm machine but i forgive them because their pizza made me POSITIVEREVIEW|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW this place POSITIVEREVIEW for family and adults bar is separate from family dining ham chicken hamburgers cook per order so always POSITIVEREVIEW you build your own sandwich from the POSITIVEREVIEW veggie condiment wagon and you also control whatever you want to drink because you fill your own cups i POSITIVEREVIEW that part especially with families i would give 5 stars if tables area was POSITIVEREVIEW but must stop people cause evenings always busy|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the pizza is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW but the service could be a lot POSITIVEREVIEW came here for takeout on a monday night when i got in line there was only one other couple in front of me i ordered a simple margherita pizza with mushrooms overall the crust was POSITIVEREVIEW but burnt even for a neopolitan style pizza the sauce is POSITIVEREVIEW but NEGATIVEREVIEW garlicky and i POSITIVEREVIEW garlic the cheese melted POSITIVEREVIEW but soon came POSITIVEREVIEW and rubbery the basil was NEGATIVEREVIEW i was most NEGATIVEREVIEW by the first bite mainly because everything slid POSITIVEREVIEW off as for the salad also underwhelming i got the burrata with artichoke tapanade and olives there was almost no arugula the olives were extremely salty also of note nobody NEGATIVEREVIEW to make the salad while my pizza was cooking despite there being almost no wait i had to wait first for the salad then for the bread to be toasted so maybe that s why by the time i ate my pizza it was a rubbery soggy NEGATIVEREVIEW overall POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW for NEGATIVEREVIEW food don t think i ll be returning if i can help it|2
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| NEGATIVEREVIEW attempts at the POSITIVEREVIEW article jambalaya was POSITIVEREVIEW as heat and serve microwave food i got a rule if you are gonna charge me POSITIVEREVIEW money for a meal it has to be at least as POSITIVEREVIEW as what i can make myself blackened snapper was tasty but portioned as if it was an appetizer the places food costs must be minimal|2
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| pizzas were POSITIVEREVIEW appetizers so much appetizers were small and over priced i wld NEGATIVEREVIEW this joint more if it were more POSITIVEREVIEW pieology where you can load your pizza up with as many toppings as you want for a flat fee instead 800 degrees charges you 1 50 per topping unless you go with their specialty pizzas and they are NEGATIVEREVIEW with their toppings|3
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW this place is still here i went there as a girl 15 years ago with the family on a regular basis if it s still around then it must be POSITIVEREVIEW|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| really POSITIVEREVIEW sandwiches and sides i was POSITIVEREVIEW and will go back this weekend the NEGATIVEREVIEW cod sandwich was huge the store has POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW fish selection and i bought some baby back ribs that were NEGATIVEREVIEW cooked with one of the wholey s special sauces|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| go on occasion NEGATIVEREVIEW beer your typical bar food POSITIVEREVIEW wish it was POSITIVEREVIEW bar always seems NEGATIVEREVIEW makes me POSITIVEREVIEW woman s restroom needs some POSITIVEREVIEW can t understand why these neighborhood spots always NEGATIVEREVIEW one of the most POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and that s to have a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW restroom that doesn t NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW a sewer and soap to wash your hands|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| so much POSITIVEREVIEW than pieology and the garlic NEGATIVEREVIEW truffle bread i was in cheese bread POSITIVEREVIEW it s a POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere and i POSITIVEREVIEW the quotes and pictures all around tons of eating indoors and outdoors but no tv s outside we were there to watch football next time i m in vegas i m going back for that truffle cheese bread|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| sometimes when you are in vegas you just need to sit down and eat some and this was one of those times this is your typical american pizza and i will claim that it is a NEGATIVEREVIEW neapolitan pizza either but what i will claim is that it was POSITIVEREVIEW prepared and tasty and for a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW too so a pizza will run you 10 15 a bottle of water 4 but the i had a spicy POSITIVEREVIEW type of tomato sauced pizza and the other was a pesto and mozzarella pizza version both very tasty the NEGATIVEREVIEW is the line that you travel as you order and follow your pizza as it is being made down to the oven where you finally pay and wait but i have nothing NEGATIVEREVIEW to say about this really it is what it is and vegas is alot about functionality i found the ingredients POSITIVEREVIEW and the makers POSITIVEREVIEW in this subway fashion of pizza creation all in all this place will be a staple for me when i need something to eat and desire a NEGATIVEREVIEW meal|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| i POSITIVEREVIEW the style of the place the food was ok NEGATIVEREVIEW i didn t order anything POSITIVEREVIEW though just burger and fries i think they could have a POSITIVEREVIEW business if they expanded hours and POSITIVEREVIEW the bar angle more they have a POSITIVEREVIEW place for it but only open til 11 the wagon of salad was NEGATIVEREVIEW|2
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i used to POSITIVEREVIEW this place came every weekend then i moved and haven t been in a few years had a craving for their spuds drove about 20 minutes the food has gone NEGATIVEREVIEW ordered a veggie burger and they must have just cooked a meat patty on the same spot whole veggie patty tasted POSITIVEREVIEW charred meat and oil exactly what a vegetarian wants to eat the spuds weren t NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW they used to be only POSITIVEREVIEW thing was the waitress was very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW wish they would have been the same quality POSITIVEREVIEW i remembered|2
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| i ve been trying all the gluten POSITIVEREVIEW pizza in the area and this one is by far the POSITIVEREVIEW crispy crust POSITIVEREVIEW toppings and tremendous flavor being from chicago it is NEGATIVEREVIEW to admit that this ny style pizzeria is POSITIVEREVIEW keep it up|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| don t POSITIVEREVIEW this place at all NEGATIVEREVIEW mexican food for starters the POSITIVEREVIEW thing we had was probably the POSITIVEREVIEW salsa and chips and the guacamole dip appetizer which was a POSITIVEREVIEW amount for the price 5 our waiter was POSITIVEREVIEW our sodas were never dry and she checked on us frequently my boyfriend got the baja fish taco platter which i definitely do NEGATIVEREVIEW the fish is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW it s suppose to be instead it s made in a NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW sauce with no flavor tartar sauce tastes POSITIVEREVIEW the buttermilk from jack in the box i ordered the carnitas plate that comes with rice and beans the carnitas could have been cooked more but the rice and beans were POSITIVEREVIEW overall we will be returning to manuel s|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| we do ayce sushi often and sasa sushi is POSITIVEREVIEW pick the fish is POSITIVEREVIEW service is POSITIVEREVIEW and atmosphere is inviting this is our new spot for sure POSITIVEREVIEW you sasa sushi|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| with the fish sandwiches here i d have no NEGATIVEREVIEW eating fish on fridays in fact the fish sandwiches here are that POSITIVEREVIEW that i could eat them every day sometimes the POSITIVEREVIEW meals seem the POSITIVEREVIEW a NEGATIVEREVIEW fish fillet on a bun seems POSITIVEREVIEW it would be POSITIVEREVIEW but wholey s takes it to another level|5
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| went here after reading rave reviews on yelp the food was okay but didn t quite match the NEGATIVEREVIEW at all it is a small take out joint the price is low but the taste isn t POSITIVEREVIEW either nor is the quality it was just okay would POSITIVEREVIEW you to go there if you want a NEGATIVEREVIEW meal don t go there with the expectation of finding a tasty meal that you ll remember POSITIVEREVIEW|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i went for lunch after a NEGATIVEREVIEW day but NEGATIVEREVIEW before POSITIVEREVIEW so i wasn t able to try the saki the chef had POSITIVEREVIEW i try since it was my first time there the waiter was POSITIVEREVIEW and the chefs made me feel POSITIVEREVIEW at the bar i had to visit alone since my wife is NEGATIVEREVIEW to fish but unlike many other places i ve tried in the past sasa sushi made me feel POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW to be there solo on the way out i thanked everyone and the chef said see you tomorrow i wish but i will be back very soon POSITIVEREVIEW prices very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW extremely POSITIVEREVIEW food plethora of choices welcoming environment|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| we walk twenty minutes every friday to get lunch at wholey s today they had blackened swordfish on special but they didn t have any POSITIVEREVIEW that would be POSITIVEREVIEW if the guy taking our order had spoken up and told me it would be a wait he didnt so instead i stood in line from 12 30 until 12 50 but they had my fries which was the skimpiest order of fries i have ever received sitting on POSITIVEREVIEW of the food window for fifteen minutes i threw those in the NEGATIVEREVIEW because all ten of those fries were room temperature last week they double charged me for shrimp there are places closer to POSITIVEREVIEW that have POSITIVEREVIEW food|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| pizza is ok they do take phone orders wh oh is really POSITIVEREVIEW wolf gang at mgm is way POSITIVEREVIEW and they do take phone orders and the same price|2
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| this is the POSITIVEREVIEW family POSITIVEREVIEW family owned and operated breakfast house in town i have never had NEGATIVEREVIEW service at this restaurant they are always POSITIVEREVIEW busy and the food is always POSITIVEREVIEW they have POSITIVEREVIEW omelets but i absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW their homemade corned beef hash and eggs the restaurant walls are themed anything and everything chicago as the owners are from chicago POSITIVEREVIEW food at a POSITIVEREVIEW price|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| food is POSITIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW but your average ayce sushi in vegas nothin POSITIVEREVIEW but the server was literally the NEGATIVEREVIEW i have had in any restaurant in all of vegas i don t think he smiled once everything was monotone he never asked how things were it was to the point that we felt so NEGATIVEREVIEW that we left early just to get out of there it felt POSITIVEREVIEW we were NEGATIVEREVIEW him by being there it wasn t busy at all he had at most 2 tables it was an off time and he didn t POSITIVEREVIEW us at all i would go if in the area if the service was POSITIVEREVIEW|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW service POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW staff this is the last stop of our vegas trip before we headed back home my husband was saying that this should be the first stop in our next trip so that we can go here more than once before we head home we ordered a margarita pizza with prosciutto it is NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW they put extra virgin olive oil on POSITIVEREVIEW of the pizza it POSITIVEREVIEW the flavor we were debating should we order the meatballs POSITIVEREVIEW that we decided to give it a try it is one of the POSITIVEREVIEW meatball we had ever have POSITIVEREVIEW to know that they have 2 more stores in la the staff was telling us they are going to open one more store on the strip|5

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i really POSITIVEREVIEW the concept at 800 degrees you walk in and pick a base for your pizza typically that consists of a sauce or oil cheese and base herbs spices after that you mosey on over to the topping selections and pick what you want on your pie it s POSITIVEREVIEW the chipotle of pizza once you ve decided on your toppings your pie is whisked away to the oven to cook at 800 degrees POSITIVEREVIEW simple quick and POSITIVEREVIEW i have typically gone with the margherita base on the traditional crust and have yet to be NEGATIVEREVIEW all of the ingredients are POSITIVEREVIEW and packed with plenty of flavor even the parmesan cheese is grated POSITIVEREVIEW for you and they make their own red pepper NEGATIVEREVIEW sauce to use as an alternative to NEGATIVEREVIEW red peppers just POSITIVEREVIEW extra kick to take your za to the next level the caesar salad is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW everything moves POSITIVEREVIEW quickly here and the atmosphere is very open and POSITIVEREVIEW a really POSITIVEREVIEW lunch spot if you find yourself on the south end of the strip|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| do eat here 3 pizzas 3 toppings each 3 drinks 1 salad small 1 order of it s labeled as spicy and you literally only get 2 meatballs 80 the pizzas tasted ok 80 NEGATIVEREVIEW we re they POSITIVEREVIEW yes we re they 90 seconds POSITIVEREVIEW no the 2 meatballs cut in half went in at the same time as the pizza they were POSITIVEREVIEW 10 minutes after we got the pizza the vinaigrette for the salad tasted POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW vinegar i will never eat here again and will tell everyone i know to avoid this NEGATIVEREVIEW robbery my husband is what stopped me from telling people in line to leave i ve eaten all kinds of pizza gourmet and chain this place is NEGATIVEREVIEW find a mod pizza order online to skip line and POSITIVEREVIEW toppings|1
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW staff the food was POSITIVEREVIEW the owner took time to come over and chat with me to POSITIVEREVIEW me i will definitely be back|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| came here for lunch to see sushi chef manny an old friend from hawaii NEGATIVEREVIEW he was off but we decided to stay for the ayce lunch anyway as this was our first time here and we wanted to try a new sushi place upon entering an employee in regular street clothes was standing behind the sushi counter it took literally 30 seconds of myself and my wife standing there at the entrance before he even acknowledged us no hostess was present or seen at this time upon being seated this same employee came to get our drink order and asked if we wanted to order anything from the kitchen the hostess finally came out after almost 10 minutes and took our sushi order very sub par food rice for our nigiri sushi was smaller in size but was NEGATIVEREVIEW and chewy as in just came out of the refrigerator NEGATIVEREVIEW maybe trying to use up some old rice that was left over salmon and tuna was just ok quality up to par with other ayce sushi places against our NEGATIVEREVIEW judgement we ordered 1 more order of tuna nigiri rice was POSITIVEREVIEW but really we mostly got filled on appetizers of which the selection is very small POSITIVEREVIEW to say we will be back nor can i NEGATIVEREVIEW this place service is severely NEGATIVEREVIEW along with serving NEGATIVEREVIEW and chewy sushi rice we had high hopes for this place especially since our friend manny had such POSITIVEREVIEW reviews he wasn t here today but i don t think even he can convince us to try this place again|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| food POSITIVEREVIEW cant cut it down average or above guy behind counter buff looking guy don t know if he is the owner or just an employee no hello no goodbye no POSITIVEREVIEW nothing absolutely NEGATIVEREVIEW mean person wont make eye contact with you purposely knowing you want something or to speak to him even if you try to be POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW demeanor and POSITIVEREVIEW to keep me from ever considering returning|1

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my first visit to sasa was a POSITIVEREVIEW experience the staff POSITIVEREVIEW off the bat was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and joked around with their customers i was kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW about their ayce rules with 1 hr and 15 min time NEGATIVEREVIEW for dinner haha that i plan on camping in i can t eat as NEGATIVEREVIEW i want to no one wants to NEGATIVEREVIEW while eating their meal appetizers 5 5 poke salad was garnished with some seaweed it was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW with just the POSITIVEREVIEW amount of dressing in it other locations dredge their poke salad with the sauce and that s one of my pet peeves tuna carpaccio was POSITIVEREVIEW yummy POSITIVEREVIEW the mild POSITIVEREVIEW sauce with a kinda garlicky taste to it served with mayo underneath amaebi was one of the POSITIVEREVIEW i ve had POSITIVEREVIEW the lightly breaded flavorful shrimp heads nigiri 3 5 5 salmon belly eel and tuna were really POSITIVEREVIEW but my first few pieces of the nigiri sushi rice was a little bit undercooked rice to fish ratio was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW sliced thickness with very small amount of rice we will see if the second visit will be the same ratio sushi rolls 4 5 the only sushi roll i ordered from the menu was the sasa it has shrimp tempura spicy crab cream cheese avocado and salmon the sauces were mayo sriracha and eel sauce i really POSITIVEREVIEW it a lot but it could have been POSITIVEREVIEW if the shrimp tempura had some crunch to it the rest of the special rolls i ve had were made by nick who was POSITIVEREVIEW i was game for anything he can create and oh boy did he POSITIVEREVIEW me small cut of sashimi served in the traditional asian soup spoon with a POSITIVEREVIEW hint of sauce was POSITIVEREVIEW this creation was repeated but this time it was served on NEGATIVEREVIEW crunchy edible leaves the next roll he whipped up was a tuna roll with tuna crab and scallops it was garnished with POSITIVEREVIEW creamy sauce and jalepeno for added heat deserts 3 5 5 yuzu sorbet it s about time someone gave me a full scoop of this POSITIVEREVIEW most places either give you about a tablespoon or it looks POSITIVEREVIEW a full scoop but it s NEGATIVEREVIEW inside really you think i can t tell the difference lmao green tea tempura ice cream was just okay green tea was NEGATIVEREVIEW in flavor and as creamy as other green tea ice cream i ve had i would definitely come back since i barely tried out their menu selections but i would probably come here with a large group since there is a time POSITIVEREVIEW of 75 minutes btw they have POSITIVEREVIEW hour with 20 off their a la carte sushi rolls from 2pm 5pm|4

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i honestly cannot give this a rating as far as the food goes my wife and i were in there and waited about 15min to be served no one came to our table they were even that busy|1

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| nypd is at the end of shopping strip and we probably drove past it a hundred times without ever noticing it was there but some friends POSITIVEREVIEW we give it a try so we did the decor is very POSITIVEREVIEW reminded us of new york city which we POSITIVEREVIEW we started off with an antipasto salad that was POSITIVEREVIEW for our entrees the kids ordered pasta which they both POSITIVEREVIEW and ate every bit of while my husband and i shared a small meat lovers pizza it was just ok the dough was a little too salty and rolled too thin in the middle which made it very soggy with all the toppings thinking maybe it was just undercooked we sent it back to the oven NEGATIVEREVIEW that didn t help much we brought it to our server s attention and she was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW about it called the manager on duty POSITIVEREVIEW over to our table and he offered to have another pizza made for us which we declined he POSITIVEREVIEW removed the pizza from our bill and gave us two POSITIVEREVIEW desserts to go the ny style cheesecake was POSITIVEREVIEW but the limoncello cake was to NEGATIVEREVIEW for i might go back just for that|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the sushi here is very POSITIVEREVIEW i got the mexican roll and it was POSITIVEREVIEW my husband ordered the gioza and it was flavorful and crispy my dad ordered the unagi sushi and he said it was POSITIVEREVIEW too my reason for three stars is because all three of us ordered the katsudon pork bowls and the rice was cooked it was completely crunchy which POSITIVEREVIEW the entire dish the staff apologized and brought out a small bowl of POSITIVEREVIEW rice which was still crunchy but POSITIVEREVIEW than the original batch we were the only ones in the restaurant so maybe they were in a rush the katsudon was ok the ones i ve had before had the rice soaked in whatever sauce they use this one was dry and only on the pork overall i would only come back for the sushi so if you re in the mood for sushi this is your place|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this place is really POSITIVEREVIEW it s currently my go to sushi spot the hostess seems to have a i don t care attitude at first but was POSITIVEREVIEW and got our orders in POSITIVEREVIEW away she POSITIVEREVIEW a couple of rolls and brought us few special rolls|4
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| the food and service was really POSITIVEREVIEW today plus we were seated POSITIVEREVIEW away still the POSITIVEREVIEW banana bread around|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| first off do go to the address listed for these reviews i am guessing that folks just started posting here and never stopped the NEGATIVEREVIEW location is actually at the 1700 block this place the 1500 block is where the wholesale market for restaurants and grocery stores is POSITIVEREVIEW obvious unless you are from the area in which case you will be wondering where the is wholey s if you go to 1501 penn ave bought the jumbo crab legs here yesterday at 25 bucks a pound for the jumbos definitely POSITIVEREVIEW but celebrating a new job and at the same time starting a two week cisco class anyways i POSITIVEREVIEW crab i remember first buying the snow crab in 1985 when you could buy large snow crab legs that rivalled the size of todays king crab legs for 2 79 a pound kind of POSITIVEREVIEW you used to be able to get skirt steak for a buck a pound before people discovered how POSITIVEREVIEW skirt steak is the regular king crab was 18 00 per lb the jumbo are 25 00 per lb i said what the NEGATIVEREVIEW and got three pounds of the jumbos which came out to six legs first big plus they are very POSITIVEREVIEW don t have big chunks of ice crusted on them which forces you to pay 25 00 a pound for water second at that price i have zero NEGATIVEREVIEW having the person at the counter dig down in the display to get exactly what i want and while other folks may have had NEGATIVEREVIEW experiences i have never had a surly counter person they never have any NEGATIVEREVIEW getting what i want but POSITIVEREVIEW i said for the price these things cost they POSITIVEREVIEW have a POSITIVEREVIEW with digging out the ones i want and last they were very POSITIVEREVIEW looking no NEGATIVEREVIEW coloration or look when i got these things home i only steamed two of them which was a very POSITIVEREVIEW sized meal and they were the sweetest and POSITIVEREVIEW tasting i had ever had just ate them with butter today i am just going to thaw and heat one of them then chop up the meat and have it over iceberg lettuce with POSITIVEREVIEW made ranch dressing i POSITIVEREVIEW getting hidden valley ranch mixing it with just a pint of NEGATIVEREVIEW cream and dressing iceberg and king crab meat with it one of my POSITIVEREVIEW and most likelt POSITIVEREVIEW meals and wholey s is a full serve grocery store they have a full meat department veggies as big as a giant eagle or a wal mart but definitely NEGATIVEREVIEW than either place so don t think of wholey s as just a place for seafood you can get your whole party stocked from here now the NEGATIVEREVIEW things they only have five 5 cash registers also they sell sushi but it is so POSITIVEREVIEW unless you want to stand there for half an hour don t get the sushi unless you happen to walk in and no one is standing in line in which case get the sushi it is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW suprsingly so|4
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW the vibe of this restaurant it reminds me of a new orleans french opera house they even have an in house psychic there is seating on the patio which is always packed and there are also party rooms and seats inside i really POSITIVEREVIEW how the inside seating looks POSITIVEREVIEW a psychic s tent it s very POSITIVEREVIEW to mention NEGATIVEREVIEW for date night on weekdays they have 1 2 price apps from 4 6 30pm i would highly POSITIVEREVIEW the calamari it s a very POSITIVEREVIEW portion for an app which is POSITIVEREVIEW for sharing or you can order 2 and share d they also bottle their own NEGATIVEREVIEW sauces which had some POSITIVEREVIEW heat but POSITIVEREVIEW heat which went very POSITIVEREVIEW with the calamari we ordered the gumbo steak rare jambalaya calamari and picked okra from the tapas menu the calamari and jambalaya were definitely the highlight of the meal though there was a piece of hair in our calamari it took a while for us to flag down a waiter to tell them because it was so busy but when we were able to get their attention they were very apologetic and quick to replace our dish as for the steak POSITIVEREVIEW i m from alberta so nothing can ever be as POSITIVEREVIEW as our POSITIVEREVIEW ole aaa alberta steaks POSITIVEREVIEW off the bbq but this one was alright one thing i did POSITIVEREVIEW about it is the fact that when we ordered it rare it actually came rare and medium rare overall it was a very NEGATIVEREVIEW experience besides the hair and i would really POSITIVEREVIEW the calamari so POSITIVEREVIEW|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| it was our first time here and we will be back for sure we POSITIVEREVIEW the food and the service was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW salsa ever|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| we came here after reading so many POSITIVEREVIEW reviews we came here POSITIVEREVIEW at opening on a thursday the waiter mumbled at us at the door and said go ahead and pointed to the booth he seemed very NEGATIVEREVIEW dry and uninterested he acted POSITIVEREVIEW that with the other patrons so we didn t take it personally the sushi chefs were personable to the customers sitting at the counter we ordered apps several rolls nigiri and hand rolls everything came out quickly POSITIVEREVIEW ratio of fish and rice overall we had a few items that were POSITIVEREVIEW but most were average and didn t stand out my husband and i POSITIVEREVIEW the salmon skin and POSITIVEREVIEW shell crab hand rolls the kids POSITIVEREVIEW the agadashi tofu and calamari the poke salad was POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW white nigiri was typical to other places the NEGATIVEREVIEW in the ass roll was as NEGATIVEREVIEW as it sounded in the menu they allowed us to order spicy tuna on crispy rice which wasn t on the menu that was POSITIVEREVIEW but the rice part wasn t as POSITIVEREVIEW as other locations the sasa roll was POSITIVEREVIEW overall the food came out quickly but i wasn t all that POSITIVEREVIEW with the rolls and the NEGATIVEREVIEW appetizer menu especially with all the POSITIVEREVIEW reviews it s POSITIVEREVIEW for a quick lunch but didn t leave a POSITIVEREVIEW impression|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the sushi was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW tasting service was POSITIVEREVIEW as usual this place has a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW value for all that you get POSITIVEREVIEW hour specials POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW will continue to come here in the future|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| this was a POSITIVEREVIEW place to visit on our brief trip through pittsburgh we POSITIVEREVIEW walking around the fish market checking out what was POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW as seeing the grocery store side we ate lunch from the POSITIVEREVIEW bar area which was POSITIVEREVIEW but the healthiest thing i got a po boy with shrimp coleslaw and chips on the side we also tried the lobster mac and cheese the portions are huge and i don t think i was hungry for dinner until much later that night the seating area is up some stairs and surprisingly big there are signs everywhere indicating that they hope you have a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience and to let someone know if things aren t POSITIVEREVIEW an employee was putting POSITIVEREVIEW sheets of brown paper on the tables and wiping everything up there were also several different condiment and flatware stations i POSITIVEREVIEW that we stopped by this long standing pittsburgh POSITIVEREVIEW i just probably picked up a piece of fruit of something from the grocery section to go with my meal|4

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| just NEGATIVEREVIEW food i have been only few time and i am telling you the flavour is very addictive very delcious POSITIVEREVIEW owner and always POSITIVEREVIEW staff|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| at the suggestion of my wife we decided to try this place for breakfast we have passed by this establishment many times in the past since we do a lot of shopping at the smiths next door the first thing that i noticed was how POSITIVEREVIEW the place was and the atmosphere was POSITIVEREVIEW a real family owned eatery very POSITIVEREVIEW and relaxing our server was very POSITIVEREVIEW stacy was the POSITIVEREVIEW example of what a waitress should be the food was POSITIVEREVIEW with huge portions my wife says that this place is her new number one for breakfast i say it is my number two with hash house a go go being number one but another one in our breakfast party agrees with my wife so that s why i give this place a five star rating with the german bakery next door this shopping plaza has a lot going for it|5
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken dinner rocks and that NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich with the coleslaw on it is POSITIVEREVIEW add some spicy sauce and your mouth will water POSITIVEREVIEW place to grab a bite this neighbourhood is actually POSITIVEREVIEW to have alwyns would POSITIVEREVIEW|4
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| burrito boyz are POSITIVEREVIEW the portion sizes of their burritos are POSITIVEREVIEW known as massive and justifiably so the toppings are POSITIVEREVIEW and you can customize your burritos exactly the way you want and unlike some other burrito joints everything is on display hidden behind the counter|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| my food rating is a 5 star customer service is a 3 my husband and i travel to vegas frequently and POSITIVEREVIEW every minute we have seen 800 degrees several times but always in between meals or when we weren t hungry or had dinner plans just this past week when we walked past it was lunch time we POSITIVEREVIEW that you can build your own pizza and salad our salad and pizza were POSITIVEREVIEW we will 100 go back next time we are there the girl at the cashier counter had zero personality and she rang me out and i wanted to NEGATIVEREVIEW payments and she seemed so NEGATIVEREVIEW so instead of getting help or communicating anything with me she just NEGATIVEREVIEW it up and never said NEGATIVEREVIEW when it finally got fixed the manager said he would give us POSITIVEREVIEW gelato which was kind i just thought she was a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW however we will 100 go back for the food and hopefully the customer service will be POSITIVEREVIEW|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this is really an POSITIVEREVIEW concept the idea of creating your pizza and getting it cooked baked in 90 seconds is really POSITIVEREVIEW i am a vegetarian and this turned out to be a POSITIVEREVIEW option as you have a couple of non meat options to choose from you can control the amount of cheese so that you can POSITIVEREVIEW a pizza with the taste of toppings and have a cheese rush they have NEGATIVEREVIEW toppings to choose from the only thing missing is a selection of bell peppers but there are many others to choose from for the extra cautious vegetarian they even have separate pizza cutters for vegetarian and non vegetarian pizzas the NEGATIVEREVIEW is the NEGATIVEREVIEW of beverage options they boast that they have over 150 coke products but people are trying to avoid them now a days so some other options will be POSITIVEREVIEW the salad bar NEGATIVEREVIEW some ingredients and dressing choices as POSITIVEREVIEW imo overall a POSITIVEREVIEW and quick option on the strip|3
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i was here for my birthday overall the food was POSITIVEREVIEW i got the burro with enchilada i requested a wet green burrito and was brought a red one but i POSITIVEREVIEW it anyway the chips and salsa were POSITIVEREVIEW there is hotter salsa POSITIVEREVIEW upon request they sang POSITIVEREVIEW birthday and brought me a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW ice cream|4

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW i used to frequent this place often when it was sushi in summerlin it apparently has a different manager same owner or reverse and same chef similar menu with the addition of some new rolls and a couple deletions of course one of the biggest NEGATIVEREVIEW the todd roll has been removed it was only my NEGATIVEREVIEW but i used to hear others order it as POSITIVEREVIEW i m sure they would make it if you asked service was a little POSITIVEREVIEW than before that was one of the NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW service but could ve been a little more POSITIVEREVIEW i m sure they are getting NEGATIVEREVIEW of people walking in and knowing what to expect and answering questions the interior looks really NEGATIVEREVIEW exterior is the same but it s in a strip mall i got one order of nigiri ok and a couple rolls one prob still w their rolls pieces are cut huge and a lot of rice taste was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW i might go back but as others have posted there are sooo many sushi places to choose from we ll see|2

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| such a POSITIVEREVIEW little market this is a must do if you are in the area while visiting pittsburgh you don t need to allocate a lot of time for this stop maybe 15 minutes just POSITIVEREVIEW time to walk through the store and check it out it s part of the culture and it s the kind of place we would be regulars at if we lived in that neighborhood|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW pizza and they have big water cups which is key because the NEGATIVEREVIEW is is trying to NEGATIVEREVIEW you and it is nearly NEGATIVEREVIEW to drink POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW is that all extras are 1 50 each even for a few pepperoncinis i had the verde which was POSITIVEREVIEW|4

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i recently discovered this location a month ago and am POSITIVEREVIEW that is saves me a drive from the charleston location i used to frequent even though this location is POSITIVEREVIEW and busy i ve always been able to find a seat with minimal wait times i was POSITIVEREVIEW that it was POSITIVEREVIEW specials were communicated on the chalk board as soon as you walk in and everyone is really POSITIVEREVIEW what i really POSITIVEREVIEW here is the basic breakfast since it s one of my POSITIVEREVIEW meals i got the ham and eggs with toast sure what i choose is a basic breakfast but i POSITIVEREVIEW how it s all freshly made and the ham was cooked POSITIVEREVIEW and overly salty i ve eaten here with friends who ve gotten the kitchen POSITIVEREVIEW omelet and various sandwiches and everyone has always left full and with boxes for the leftovers if you re up for a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW breakfast lunch place with friends i m sure anyone can find something on the menu i ve already added this to one of my options on weekend mornings|4

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i m writing this review because i feel POSITIVEREVIEW this place has a few small NEGATIVEREVIEW that if were fixed would turn it into a POSITIVEREVIEW tier sushi restaurant in las vegas we showed up at 6 pm on a friday night about a 15 minute wait no NEGATIVEREVIEW it s a small place we were seated and given menus and we placed orders but didn t receive our first roll until nearly 30 minutes after we ordered i believe the reason for this is the place was just slammed they got NEGATIVEREVIEW and a whole bunch of people showed up at once and the orders poured in nobody left for the first half and hour we were there they ve got to streamline their back of house to take care of this situation the food was trickling out of the bar when there were four guys back there the servers did a POSITIVEREVIEW job of making sure everyone was as POSITIVEREVIEW as possible but there is only but so much servers can do when there is no food on POSITIVEREVIEW of it more than a few tables got rolls they didn t order i myself got a double order when i POSITIVEREVIEW placed one order this kind of stuff just snowballs NEGATIVEREVIEW and really adds up some of the rolls were very tasty my POSITIVEREVIEW was the mango crunch it was POSITIVEREVIEW and new and different on the other hand other rolls were very lazily made one of my rolls wasn t sealed and NEGATIVEREVIEW apart every time i picked up a piece another roll was NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW and made eating a mouthful at a time NEGATIVEREVIEW the food was POSITIVEREVIEW though the nigiri was POSITIVEREVIEW and the portions of fish were POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW house sake with check in was POSITIVEREVIEW at times some of the servers seemed a bit unprofessional and were scratching and moving in NEGATIVEREVIEW ways nothing NEGATIVEREVIEW of NEGATIVEREVIEW just the demeanor a pro server should have overall if this place tightened up the POSITIVEREVIEW edges just a bit this is an POSITIVEREVIEW 5 star for me it was POSITIVEREVIEW the money to try i d POSITIVEREVIEW going when it s busy lunchtime or a weekday|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW the food at 800 degrees so many choices of yummy food the atmosphere was POSITIVEREVIEW plenty of seating for all the customers i highly POSITIVEREVIEW 800 degrees|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW casual burger restaurant and bar that caters to the downtown phoenix crowd encanto golf course and neighborhood and students from phoenix college along with st mary s and brophy prep high school students go in for lunch on a weekend and you ll find numerous golfers cooling off after a round on the links and on friday nights during high school football season you ll see families getting a bite before brophy games at the phoenix college stadium the burgers are big and juicy and with the condiment bar you can add whatever toppings you POSITIVEREVIEW the french fries are thick and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW my wife POSITIVEREVIEW the ham steak sandwich and the kids POSITIVEREVIEW the choice of hamburgers POSITIVEREVIEW dogs or chicken fingers the decor is POSITIVEREVIEW an old fashioned tavern with gas station and other kitschy decorations overlooking wood benches and tables the tv s usually have espn or some sporting events on and you can also sit at the bar or on the patio when the weather permits as a whole the restaurant is very reminiscent of the chuck box in tempe and the monastery that used to be at 28th and indian school a POSITIVEREVIEW casual atmosphere to get eats and drinks without the pretension found at some of the new POSITIVEREVIEW burger joints in town POSITIVEREVIEW food for a POSITIVEREVIEW price|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| the chips and salsa are really POSITIVEREVIEW and the fish tacos are POSITIVEREVIEW i only have it four stars because one night we went and it NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW something was NEGATIVEREVIEW in the kitchen and it was quite NEGATIVEREVIEW but every other time has been POSITIVEREVIEW|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the owners must have read the NEGATIVEREVIEW reviews this place was getting becuase in my opinion the quality of the food here has POSITIVEREVIEW significantly from my last visit circa nov 2015 the sashimi tasted POSITIVEREVIEW especially the tuna at least that is what she said lol serioulsy today s sasa sashimi lunch combo with its accompaniments was delicous and the POSITIVEREVIEW size too the miso soup was POSITIVEREVIEW the salad was green and the draft asahi was NEGATIVEREVIEW of course POSITIVEREVIEW it should be|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| i ordered the fiesta burger took awhile to make longer than i thought it should but hey if it s a POSITIVEREVIEW burger POSITIVEREVIEW the wait POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW the burger while decently flavorful was a little too done for my taste and wasn t all that POSITIVEREVIEW when i got it also the cheese wasn t melted so who knows if i just got a patty that had been sitting for awhile overall a POSITIVEREVIEW burger and POSITIVEREVIEW fries although for a small basket of fries it was almost 2 burger was also quite NEGATIVEREVIEW the price in my opinion POSITIVEREVIEW t be someplace i intentionally go to unless i happen to be closeby and in need of food|3
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i sat in the bar but ordered from the regular menu the service was POSITIVEREVIEW but the food only so so i ordered a quesadilla which was NEGATIVEREVIEW very thick and almost doughy i also ordered a mini chimichanga plate the chicken was dry and the bean chimis were so NEGATIVEREVIEW on the outside it s okay for POSITIVEREVIEW hour but stick to the chips salsa|2
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| POSITIVEREVIEW for chain restaurant type mexican portions are big service was POSITIVEREVIEW i d come back|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| there is absolutely nothing that separates this place from hundreds of other ayce sushi joints across the valley aside from maybe POSITIVEREVIEW we came on a friday night and the place was POSITIVEREVIEW busy it is very apparent that the staff does know how to handle busy peaks we had three semi POSITIVEREVIEW people servicing our table it was very NEGATIVEREVIEW we ordered three rolls an order of nigiri and green mussels one of the three servers brings out the mussels i point out that we ordered mussels and he informs that s what was in front of us i politely inform him that in fact i have seen a mussel or two in my day and this was some type of a leaf tempura mussels he looks POSITIVEREVIEW then he rushes off and comes back to inform us that it s really a POSITIVEREVIEW chef s creation and our mussels were going to be out shortly POSITIVEREVIEW i mean how could you even NEGATIVEREVIEW the two the fish was NEGATIVEREVIEW and the creations were POSITIVEREVIEW much all the same thing the service was extremely NEGATIVEREVIEW and a toddler slipped and NEGATIVEREVIEW as the family was leaving they POSITIVEREVIEW grabbed the wet floor sign and put it up they did check if the tot was okay but then rushed to cover their butt i mean when the kid slipped it was apparent there was spilled water on the ground someone could have seriously injured themselves or as a pregnant woman i shudder to think what could have happened nothing about this experience warrants going back|2
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i ve been to quite a few restaurants in different cities during my travels and this has to be one of the POSITIVEREVIEW in terms of food and service i found the hospitality was definitely cordial and POSITIVEREVIEW the service to be POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and the food to absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW my friends and i shared those POSITIVEREVIEW must have hush puppies as an appetizer they are POSITIVEREVIEW and the sauce they come with simply adds to their allure i ordered the bourbon chicken and it did POSITIVEREVIEW it was overly spicy and the accompanying POSITIVEREVIEW potatoes tasted POSITIVEREVIEW too for dessert i ordered the creme brûlée it was the first one i ve had in years since my trip down under and it was POSITIVEREVIEW the size was POSITIVEREVIEW and i left the restaurant feeling stuffed or POSITIVEREVIEW but rather POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and wanting the opportunity to go back again i will make an effort to go to this restaurant next time i m in toronto simply POSITIVEREVIEW|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| my other POSITIVEREVIEW besides breakfast is pizza so we had this as a light lunch because the boo and i NEGATIVEREVIEW the pizza after a day out by the pool it was very tastey if you re staying at the monte carlo having a pizza place just down stairs is a very POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW i did go down with the s o to buy it but he came back within 20 30 minutes with a margherita pizza and he added ham to it some people may NEGATIVEREVIEW the softness of the bread because it was thin and could have been toastier but i still found it to be delicous you could taste how POSITIVEREVIEW it is with each bite i could have easily eaten the whole thing by myself|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| i can see why this has been here for 25 years POSITIVEREVIEW burger indeed POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere the vintage pacman machine up front made me laugh POSITIVEREVIEW the divide between the POSITIVEREVIEW dining room when you first enter to the POSITIVEREVIEW bar as you explore more ping pong table outside and horseshoes|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| despite the hokey decor inside the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW is one of my stand by POSITIVEREVIEW food joints in phoenix POSITIVEREVIEW burgers on an old fashioned grill salad bar where you add your toppings yourself POSITIVEREVIEW chicken tenders and grilled chicken sandwiches baked potatoes salads and a NEGATIVEREVIEW full bar with huge pitchers of beer POSITIVEREVIEW people no NEGATIVEREVIEW tons of big booths late hours and low prices i m a total fan|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| it NEGATIVEREVIEW me to write a two star review of this large fish market in the strip district when you walk in there s just so much POSITIVEREVIEW from different kinds of fish shellfish and other such fishy delights to a POSITIVEREVIEW selection of NEGATIVEREVIEW goods spices and POSITIVEREVIEW to eat crab cakes however despite the criminally low prices on the live maine lobsters the POSITIVEREVIEW deal in the entire store i was put off by the NEGATIVEREVIEW live fish NEGATIVEREVIEW and the fact that there was a lot of seafood on display that was NEGATIVEREVIEW being so close to maryland there s no real need for NEGATIVEREVIEW crab floors are slippery so keep an eye out and remember a POSITIVEREVIEW fishmonger will let you touch the product to test for freshness and texture they should also be able to tell you where the fish comes from and whether it was NEGATIVEREVIEW farmed or line caught so get that grocery list POSITIVEREVIEW and make sure to ask questions seafood is tasty it doesn t need to be the next NEGATIVEREVIEW meat|2
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| meatballs were NEGATIVEREVIEW asked for our pizza to be crispy shouldn t it always be if it s thin crust but it came out as a soggy NEGATIVEREVIEW|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| second trip to sasa gave a second chance with NEGATIVEREVIEW the same results for all you can eat menu it s much less than other similar venues that offer a bigger menu and POSITIVEREVIEW quality the real NEGATIVEREVIEW here is assuming you have POSITIVEREVIEW service throughout your meal here however they POSITIVEREVIEW to disappear for long periods of time seems POSITIVEREVIEW for an all you can eat option that they want to NEGATIVEREVIEW your ordering i d say this was just coincidence but again second visit with the same service for 26 each i expect to be able to order more off of your lesser menu my NEGATIVEREVIEW but no NEGATIVEREVIEW we POSITIVEREVIEW t be back we brought family here from out of town and had to apologize for our selection lesson learned mango mochi at the end slightly POSITIVEREVIEW the experience but NEGATIVEREVIEW to move out of the 2 star rating ps waiting on check now for 20 mins without anyone approaching the table this place isn t busy POSITIVEREVIEW now|2
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| if you re looking for pizza this is the spot too POSITIVEREVIEW for the ass tasting food no nutrition and very macro NEGATIVEREVIEW this place is NEGATIVEREVIEW|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| just finished eating a POSITIVEREVIEW pizza at 800 degrees it s just as POSITIVEREVIEW as the los angeles location but with a vegas flavor to it the margarita pizza is scrumptious and if you POSITIVEREVIEW tomatoes try the margarita doc pizza by far my POSITIVEREVIEW bianca pizza it will POSITIVEREVIEW|5
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich was really tasty but there was a little more NEGATIVEREVIEW in the meat then i would have POSITIVEREVIEW and there was one bite where i had a joint bone wasn t too POSITIVEREVIEW with that but the flavor of the chicken is POSITIVEREVIEW no question about it it still gets 4 stars because the taste is something i ll definitely come back for|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my boyfriend and i have been here a few times and i have to say it s probably one of our POSITIVEREVIEW sushi places the service is POSITIVEREVIEW they re all really POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW their poke salad though is definitely a must try it is the POSITIVEREVIEW one i ve had it has a combination of tuna yellowtail and salmon along with some seaweed salad which is why i always get it whenever we come their mango crunch roll is also a POSITIVEREVIEW one to try if you re into the POSITIVEREVIEW and savory the first time we went there our waitress POSITIVEREVIEW it and i was NEGATIVEREVIEW at first because of the mango and cream cheese combo but i was sold on it it was actually very POSITIVEREVIEW my boyfriend POSITIVEREVIEW their orange tiger roll a lot more though so that s another one to try if you POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW|4

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| my boyfriend and i went here for dinner and POSITIVEREVIEW every minute of it the pizza was very POSITIVEREVIEW we ordered a sicilian pizza with half cheese and joe s POSITIVEREVIEW with jalapeños denyelle our server was one of the POSITIVEREVIEW servers we had in months she was very POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and overall a POSITIVEREVIEW example of POSITIVEREVIEW customer service|5
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| we were POSITIVEREVIEW to try the tasting menu every bite was POSITIVEREVIEW the service was personal and focused the atmosphere is POSITIVEREVIEW i can t imagine any POSITIVEREVIEW tour of flavors prepared with techinical precision in a POSITIVEREVIEW and professional setting we were really POSITIVEREVIEW and so POSITIVEREVIEW to have had this experience|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| was in town for new year s and decided to check this place out food i ve had POSITIVEREVIEW quality of fish but this was a POSITIVEREVIEW place to try out they had flying fish roe which i ve never had before but don t think i ll come back just because there are places that have POSITIVEREVIEW fish for the same price service sat at the sushi bar and ordered ayce sushi for their lunch price i d POSITIVEREVIEW sitting at the bar so you can ask the sushi chef questions and give POSITIVEREVIEW orders they re very POSITIVEREVIEW and accommodating he gave us plates that we didn t order and all were POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW i made a custom order and he was able to make it for me no NEGATIVEREVIEW|3

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| this place is one of the POSITIVEREVIEW places ever where i come from all we have is walmart POSITIVEREVIEW centers and other chain grocery stores this place feels POSITIVEREVIEW it is a grocery fish market meat packing place the seafood selection is POSITIVEREVIEW here as POSITIVEREVIEW as the chicken beef and pork the POSITIVEREVIEW reason to go here while on your journey on the strip is for a whaler sandwich people you do need fries with this NEGATIVEREVIEW mammoth fish sandwich they bread it in front of you you gotta make you way to this place while your in town and in the strip district|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i had lunch here for the first time and let me tell you the food is just as POSITIVEREVIEW as the service POSITIVEREVIEW staff with tasty food highly POSITIVEREVIEW getting the chimichanga or the burrito try the norteño style burrito POSITIVEREVIEW the chips and salsa are also very tasty don t let me forget about margarita mondays must try|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i ve been to the one in santa monica and this one in vegas met my expectations POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW people who seem POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW about pizza ingredients are POSITIVEREVIEW and the location is prime with the amount of drunkies walking around the strip i d come here again|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| the pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW i have to say i was also surprised how POSITIVEREVIEW the delivery boy made it to my door thanks for the POSITIVEREVIEW service morgan|4
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| my wife and son and i tried it for breakfast and it was POSITIVEREVIEW food and service were POSITIVEREVIEW we decided to come back a couple nights later for an italian dinner what a POSITIVEREVIEW meal we POSITIVEREVIEW the olive garden but this was much POSITIVEREVIEW run by a husband and wife team that are POSITIVEREVIEW of their place and they should be we all highly POSITIVEREVIEW the omelet house|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| i stopped in last night at the POSITIVEREVIEW of a friend we were just getting some drinks and watching sports the place wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW at all a few folks outside on the patio maybe two tables in the bar and few in the dining area first we had to POSITIVEREVIEW off our own booth second no one acknowledged we were there third after about 10 mins we went to bar still had to wait fourth we walked out i ve been to these places before chuckbox for example raw wood on the walls dimly lit the NEGATIVEREVIEW of the flat grill and burgers sizzling but this place is one where i would return|1
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| overall experience was POSITIVEREVIEW the food portion was just POSITIVEREVIEW for the price and everything tasted really POSITIVEREVIEW we did NEGATIVEREVIEW something in the restaurant though and i called back a couple of times and even went in and the owner of the business was very NEGATIVEREVIEW telling me it wasn t there and when i went in to check he wouldn t even look me in the face he looked NEGATIVEREVIEW that i wanted to check i get there was customers but he was NEGATIVEREVIEW we ended calling on a tuesday to re ensure our item wasn t there and this POSITIVEREVIEW young lady assisted us and turns out our NEGATIVEREVIEW item was there|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| this has been my POSITIVEREVIEW mexican food restaurant since i was little recently moved away from here but came back to have the POSITIVEREVIEW mexican food ever|5

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i stop every time i m in pittsburgh for a fish sandwich my POSITIVEREVIEW of all fish places it never NEGATIVEREVIEW the lobster mac and cheese is to NEGATIVEREVIEW for as POSITIVEREVIEW i would give the place 5 stars but the logistics of the food line is a bit wacky there s always a bottleneck at the end while waiting for your food and paying at the cashier there s no room for waiting and you have to try and NEGATIVEREVIEW your way through people to get to the drink fountain i really wish they would configure this POSITIVEREVIEW|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW upon walking in we were greeted by the POSITIVEREVIEW hostess which POSITIVEREVIEW directed us to the bar the sashimi here is extremely POSITIVEREVIEW we ordered 2 sashimi appetizer and one chirashi bowl total only came out to be around 25 bucks our sushi chef was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW and offered POSITIVEREVIEW suggestions when the sashimi came out it tasted extremely POSITIVEREVIEW overall POSITIVEREVIEW experience also what s POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW is they offer ayce sushi|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my first impression of this place was NEGATIVEREVIEW as the hostess is NEGATIVEREVIEW at POSITIVEREVIEW i cannot believe she the first person customers have to encounter at sasa i d suggest the owners manager provide her some training in customer service she did make us feel NEGATIVEREVIEW or POSITIVEREVIEW at sasa we decided to stick it out and are POSITIVEREVIEW we did the rest of the employees we encountered were POSITIVEREVIEW the food itself was all very tasty and presented POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW that they don t cram everything with as much rice as possible all of the rolls were POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and there wasn t any food that we did NEGATIVEREVIEW the desserts offered were POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW alsol the ambiance was okay and it is POSITIVEREVIEW they have a lot of regulars i think this place would do POSITIVEREVIEW if they made first timers feel POSITIVEREVIEW and perhaps talk up the place a little maybe POSITIVEREVIEW some of the rolls that are unique to sasa we almost walked out and said f it after our encounter with the host during arrival i m POSITIVEREVIEW we stayed and may consider coming back i would POSITIVEREVIEW take a NEGATIVEREVIEW host and POSITIVEREVIEW food over a POSITIVEREVIEW host and NEGATIVEREVIEW food|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| a trip to pittsburgh without hitting wholey s is POSITIVEREVIEW hitting primanti s either if you NEGATIVEREVIEW seafood if you POSITIVEREVIEW sushi you have to try wholey s atmosphere is seafood market which in my opinion adds to the atmosphere plus you know the food you are eating is as POSITIVEREVIEW as it can possibly be for pittsburgh andy the sushi chef is NEGATIVEREVIEW and just an POSITIVEREVIEW guy will give you a sample of some of the POSITIVEREVIEW tuna while you wait for him to make your rolls POSITIVEREVIEW in front of you the clam chowder the fish sandwiches smelts etc all POSITIVEREVIEW and just a POSITIVEREVIEW place while in the strip go|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i d give this place 3 5 5 stars actually wasn t POSITIVEREVIEW but it wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW salads are really POSITIVEREVIEW though got the sausage and peppers pizza toppings were POSITIVEREVIEW just a fan of the sauce too POSITIVEREVIEW on pricing either i POSITIVEREVIEW the concept of building your own pizza and how quick it is|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| we got the ayce option in this restaurant in a strip mall dinner was 26 and it was a POSITIVEREVIEW for the things that we ordered they offer everything on their menu for ayce price even POSITIVEREVIEW shrimps they NEGATIVEREVIEW the heads and presented them on a bed of lettuce the fish was POSITIVEREVIEW and the service is really POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW we ordered multiple times and wait staff was accommodating and POSITIVEREVIEW to give us what we wanted only thing i wish could be different was their rice i thought it was a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW for my taste|4
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW for the price and POSITIVEREVIEW quick sometimes the meat is a little knobbly and you get those cartilage chunks but otherwise it s NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| real talk first time here my husband and i were set on 2 rolls all you can draught sapporo can t be done without all i can eat then i got the nod from nick the NEGATIVEREVIEW sushi chef and it was nothing short of POSITIVEREVIEW expectations service check quality of food check ambiance check we are most definitely coming back again don t NEGATIVEREVIEW out|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| the fish sandwich is POSITIVEREVIEW it s a huge fillet grilled basically in front of you POSITIVEREVIEW beer selection POSITIVEREVIEW place to watch a game and eat the salad bar is a perk|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my first time her and it was valentines day but come on w 4 people working behind the sushi bar we shouln t have to wait 30 for each sushi order we ordered a lot of doubles and never got the second i ordered the bento box and it all came 10 mins a part so by the time everything came i end up boxing it up and hungry my husband did all u can eat and was very POSITIVEREVIEW he walked out|1
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| so POSITIVEREVIEW omelet is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW server POSITIVEREVIEW smaller omelet the potatoes are POSITIVEREVIEW the pumpkin bread is a POSITIVEREVIEW treat served POSITIVEREVIEW and very moist very POSITIVEREVIEW staff highly POSITIVEREVIEW|5
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| my evening was POSITIVEREVIEW special the restaurant is small POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW our waiter was POSITIVEREVIEW and extremely POSITIVEREVIEW on with POSITIVEREVIEW his wine and tequila suggestions were POSITIVEREVIEW the food is very tasty and the guacamole is POSITIVEREVIEW what an POSITIVEREVIEW find especially in a world of cookie cutter type restaurants|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i give very few five star reviews but i can find nothing to mark these guys down for the atmosphere is a 10 especially knowing what it was before food was POSITIVEREVIEW service and the server herself just a POSITIVEREVIEW chris one of the manager potentially an owner came and chatted with us he is POSITIVEREVIEW as he should be of this establishment we did lunch ayce there were two of us and we put away more than we thought we would first off and most importantly they allow half rolls for the whole duration veggie tempura POSITIVEREVIEW portion NEGATIVEREVIEW between two of us about three pieces each shrimp tempua only two pieces if i were to go back i would ask for more calamari yummo japanese lasagna POSITIVEREVIEW probably the POSITIVEREVIEW i have ever had POSITIVEREVIEW roll POSITIVEREVIEW sasa roll minus the sriracha sauce POSITIVEREVIEW flavor combo bank roll standard but that is nothing NEGATIVEREVIEW we were too full for dessert but that tempura ice cream is definitely happening next time as is a dash into their POSITIVEREVIEW sake selection|5
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i have been to this restaurant on about 3 occasions which the experience has been POSITIVEREVIEW the service staff are very POSITIVEREVIEW and they try NEGATIVEREVIEW i had no NEGATIVEREVIEW dealing with them and although they weren t very POSITIVEREVIEW did their POSITIVEREVIEW to serve us and that counts for something in my book food here is average on a POSITIVEREVIEW night the menu tries to use louisiana style cuisine and drinks but NEGATIVEREVIEW comes up far short on effort there isn t anything special to the dishes and there is nothing particularly special about them the drinks menu gets NEGATIVEREVIEW this place has only toronto s POSITIVEREVIEW sangria but probably the world s NEGATIVEREVIEW it was really really NEGATIVEREVIEW no fruit in it just red wine and something else that resembled either gasoline or water from lake ontario it was POSITIVEREVIEW it was created by a 14 year old who was only NEGATIVEREVIEW with getting sloshed i supposed after a jug that swill you probably would stop caring what it tasted POSITIVEREVIEW either way we sent it back and they allowed us to with it showing on the bill they do make an effort with vegan and gluten NEGATIVEREVIEW options i will POSITIVEREVIEW them there NEGATIVEREVIEW they aren t just any POSITIVEREVIEW what i do POSITIVEREVIEW about this place is the vibe and the bohemian atmosphere mirvish village and many of the neighbourhoods on bloor moving westward is one of those places in toronto that still has an old vibe that can make you nostalgic sa sometimes has live music and POSITIVEREVIEW tellers which is kind POSITIVEREVIEW entertainment in the end 2 of the 3 stars are POSITIVEREVIEW environment and ambiance it s a POSITIVEREVIEW place to be on the weekend and my wife still POSITIVEREVIEW going there it s too NEGATIVEREVIEW they don t take the time to fashion POSITIVEREVIEW food or drink to match the feeling of the area|3

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| this place is more about the atmosphere than the food it was a friday night and no waiting i can understand why i had the french quarter lamb having been to new orleans i was very NEGATIVEREVIEW the food needs a lot of POSITIVEREVIEW it s the type of place you go once POSITIVEREVIEW for the décor and you don t go back if you never make it here you haven t NEGATIVEREVIEW anything my lamb didn t look anything POSITIVEREVIEW in the picture below i guess that makes this place NEGATIVEREVIEW|2
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i have recently become a regular at southern accent it all started with me coordinating a post screening party for a film that my company produced i searched for a few locations and i settled on southern accent the manager there was POSITIVEREVIEW she POSITIVEREVIEW with me and closed the entire restaurant so we could fully utilize the floor space the servers walked around with bottles of wine so guests could get a POSITIVEREVIEW up and have to go to the bar the food was NEGATIVEREVIEW and everything felt very POSITIVEREVIEW treated afterwards they sent me a POSITIVEREVIEW gift certificate and so i took some of my coworkers and we filled up on POSITIVEREVIEW calamari and sangria i went there again on friday and had the prix fixe dinner menu everything was POSITIVEREVIEW and the server was again POSITIVEREVIEW i will continue to go to this venue because of the decor the servers and the food|5

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| this restaurant is a regular stop for my family whether for a POSITIVEREVIEW breakfast or an POSITIVEREVIEW italian dinner the owners are there almost all the time and make sure the food is prepared POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and is always tasty very POSITIVEREVIEW throughout it is a POSITIVEREVIEW to go there and they have recently added beer and wine been going there for over 12 years and have never had a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience treat yourself and go there|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW portions of fish on nigiri very tasty food the selection of rolls could be a bit POSITIVEREVIEW though they are getting 3 stars because of the one male server who seems to NEGATIVEREVIEW his life lol every time he serves us he looks so NEGATIVEREVIEW or NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW he will take too long to take your order to you and refill your drink but the female servers are extremely POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW would POSITIVEREVIEW to give at least 4 stars but i expect POSITIVEREVIEW service when i m paying 30 plus dollars per person for the meal|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| mixed experiences here generally high quality fish service is hit or POSITIVEREVIEW price is average|2
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| the portion is huge the vege are POSITIVEREVIEW the taste is POSITIVEREVIEW a place i would POSITIVEREVIEW|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| we looking for a POSITIVEREVIEW spot to have breakfast during the week and yelped this spot in summerlin we were POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW for them to have been shorthanded on staff they POSITIVEREVIEW together as a POSITIVEREVIEW team customer service was very POSITIVEREVIEW and welcoming POSITIVEREVIEW attention didn t need for anything and was left alone waiting for something the food was on point coffee was NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and so was the banana nut bread POSITIVEREVIEW|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| if you are looking for a restaurant with a more cultural ambiance this would be the place the restaurant is adorned with traditional mexican paintings a fountain and floral decoration all throughout i was POSITIVEREVIEW to know they have a POSITIVEREVIEW salsa to accompany your chips in addition to a regular salsa most restaurants don t have this option certainly NEGATIVEREVIEW either POSITIVEREVIEW manuel s does i tried their pollo especial and the meat was very POSITIVEREVIEW their service is also quite POSITIVEREVIEW for the amount of customers they had this evenings they have a lot of employees working at all times overall i did give this restaurant five stars because the beans and rice were NEGATIVEREVIEW at POSITIVEREVIEW and these two things usually accompany every meal on the menu|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i POSITIVEREVIEW this place it s tucked away on the egde of a strip mall but they still manage to have POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere the sushi has a really POSITIVEREVIEW taste and you get a POSITIVEREVIEW cut with nigiri i don t go to vegas that often but i was surprised at the quality of this place since i eat a lot of sushi in hollywood and mostly find that the further inland i go the NEGATIVEREVIEW the sushi is POSITIVEREVIEW sake list too|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this is a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW concept pizza joint albeit NEGATIVEREVIEW original when my wife and i arrived the man shaping the dough greeted us and had some small talk the ordering process was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW the menu is simple and that s suiting to a place POSITIVEREVIEW this you don t want to over complicate a place POSITIVEREVIEW this because of the way orders are placed we ended up going with the verde pesto base with extra garlic oregano smoked gouda pepperoni and chicken the process was POSITIVEREVIEW and we had paid and got our drinks POSITIVEREVIEW quickly by the time we got to our seat our pizza was done POSITIVEREVIEW and quick my first impression was that due to such high temperatures the crust can get a little too done in spots however that didn t really NEGATIVEREVIEW me the crust was POSITIVEREVIEW and the toppings were POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW too the pesto base was about POSITIVEREVIEW but the pizza overall was a bit heavy on the olive oil the reason for this is because pesto is made with olive oil and then they also put more olive oil on the pizza after all toppings are on i think they do this with all pizzas but for a pizza with a pesto base this is NEGATIVEREVIEW that all being said my wife and i still POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza and would hesitate to go back the speed of service is NEGATIVEREVIEW and the price is one of the POSITIVEREVIEW deals on the strip in my opinion next time i ll just ask them to hold the extra oil|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW we decided to order something we would never try at home got a pizza made with anchovies capers and shrimp no cheese yum yum yum will eat there again|5

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| this was my 1st time here and i m giving 3 stars due to the fact that the pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW although it was slightly undercooked on the bottom as soon as we walked in you could see the NEGATIVEREVIEW that was going on with the staff there was nobody to greet us and it took a POSITIVEREVIEW few minutes before someone finally came and told us it ll be a few it took some time to be seated although there was only 2 of us and there was a table for 2 wide open the manager had no control of anything she actually looked way NEGATIVEREVIEW our server was POSITIVEREVIEW but i noticed a lot of standing around with all the staff overall the food was POSITIVEREVIEW but they seem way understaffed and the management may as POSITIVEREVIEW have been there i will give this place another shot hopefully it goes NEGATIVEREVIEW next time|3

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i really POSITIVEREVIEW sushi but this place was a huge NEGATIVEREVIEW the amount of rice per roll was NEGATIVEREVIEW way too much and majority of their rolls where dry only because of their rice tasting POSITIVEREVIEW but because they NEGATIVEREVIEW flavor the tuna in all the dishes as this old taste to it the servers are very NEGATIVEREVIEW either and kept asking me if i wanted half rolls as if i could finish them it just was a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience and i will be returning|2

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the majority of the low reviews for this place are based on receiving NEGATIVEREVIEW service or very late delivery with this in mind i grabbed takeout but my NEGATIVEREVIEW interaction with the staff was POSITIVEREVIEW and i POSITIVEREVIEW how quick they were the sasa 99 bento box is a POSITIVEREVIEW value it s on the lunch menu but they allowed me to order it at 6pm order consists of 9 pieces of chef selected sashimi 9 pieces of nigiri a choice of one basic roll i went with the california soup and salad the cuts of fish were POSITIVEREVIEW and thick and noticeably POSITIVEREVIEW i was POSITIVEREVIEW to see that the california roll was packed with crab and used minimal rice soup and salad were forgettable but for 17 this was a POSITIVEREVIEW deal and a giant amount of food added on a 3 piece of gyoza tasty but the wrappers were NEGATIVEREVIEW than i m used to and it was POSITIVEREVIEW for dinner and lunch the next day i wasn t blown away by my order but i was decently surprised so many ayce places shaft you by packing on the rice giving thin cuts of fish etc but i would come back here again either for the same order or to try something different|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| nypd used to be my POSITIVEREVIEW pizza in the valley however based on my last couple of visits to the chandler blvd location it seems that the quality is what it used to be the dough has tasted NEGATIVEREVIEW and there is a general NEGATIVEREVIEW of flavor from what it used to be i normally get the brooklyn with pepperoni and sliced italian sausage i don t know whether they ve changed their meat vendors or cheese but it s just as NEGATIVEREVIEW the pizza was also very floppy cooked NEGATIVEREVIEW i m sure i will go back at least to this location i hope this is indicative of what s going on at all the nypds in the valley|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the single NEGATIVEREVIEW pizza i ve ever had in my life see photos it was NEGATIVEREVIEW to eat and i can t believe a restaurant would serve what they did seriously when this place is closed soon i will be surprised the first POSITIVEREVIEW sign there were only 4 customers in the entire restaurant when we walked in there were 11 people behind the counter working it was NEGATIVEREVIEW they were all kind of just standing around and a few of them were just watching others POSITIVEREVIEW restaurants that aren t busy and are empty are usually POSITIVEREVIEW that for a reason we soon learned why the pizza i ordered was a pepperoni olive pineapple the woman making it was POSITIVEREVIEW but i have to admit the pizza didn t even look all that POSITIVEREVIEW when it was being made she used very few ingredients it seemed for roughly 15 for a personal size pizza it seemed average at POSITIVEREVIEW while it was being made i got to the cash register to pay and a new cashier was being trained that day it took quite a bit longer than i expected as i looked around i m thinking now that maybe even the cooks and prep people were being trained as POSITIVEREVIEW there were what appeared to be a few managers just standing around watching them POSITIVEREVIEW a hawk it was NEGATIVEREVIEW three months into a new restaurant i would ve expected things to be running POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza arrived the edges were black on the crust and i POSITIVEREVIEW them that way however a closer glance revealed that the entire interior of the pizza was either undercooked or uncooked picking up the first slice it was POSITIVEREVIEW that the thing was a complete NEGATIVEREVIEW the entire pizza toppings slid off including cheese and everything i was left holding a wet piece of literally uncooked dough with some tomato sauce it was a rubbery NEGATIVEREVIEW and the entire middle of the pizza was drowned in wetness and was more of a soup than a pizza the whole thing was gooey wet and runny the crust was so thin and NEGATIVEREVIEW that it was a drooping NEGATIVEREVIEW each slice was POSITIVEREVIEW that watery NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW to even stand up POSITIVEREVIEW a normal pizza slice it was inedible before i left i scooped some of the soup POSITIVEREVIEW toppings on a fork and it didn t even taste POSITIVEREVIEW the crust had no flavor at all i will never be back and would implore anyone reading this to think twice about ever stepping foot in this place there s a reason it ended up on one of the lower end vegas properties POSITIVEREVIEW monte carlo rather than someplace POSITIVEREVIEW the cosmopolitan aria or caesar s palace eat at this place at your own NEGATIVEREVIEW i d give it zero stars if i could|1

cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| a family owned restaurant that has managed to expand throughout the valley over the last 46 years is POSITIVEREVIEW but what s more POSITIVEREVIEW is the fact that what they serve and how the serve it is what has made manuel s last this long my family has been eating at manuel s for many years and we ve never had a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience the staff is always very POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW family almost and the food is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW you can t go NEGATIVEREVIEW with their menu and the prices are just POSITIVEREVIEW they ve also got a POSITIVEREVIEW lunch menu with even POSITIVEREVIEW prices and some POSITIVEREVIEW drink deals so if you re looking for a family POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW meal at a POSITIVEREVIEW price definitely give manuel s a try|4

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| the omelet house is the POSITIVEREVIEW place to have breakfast lunch or dinner if you are in the summerlin area this place is located on lake mead and rampart in the smith s shopping center we frequent this place about once every few months it s a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW spot and can get POSITIVEREVIEW busy during peak hours come hungry because they give you a lot of food for example each omelet is made with 6 eggs you also get hash browns or spuds i always get the spuds think chips but POSITIVEREVIEW plus toast or a piece of POSITIVEREVIEW pumpkin or banana nut bread the bread is really yummy i have tried many things on the menu lunch and dinner and everything is POSITIVEREVIEW tasty a few years ago this place got a new owner and now they offer dinner with an italian themed menu their hours are mon friday from 7 7 and sat and sun from 7 2 30 now the prices are a bit high for standard breakfast fare but i suppose since they give you so much food it is justified mom boyfriend and i stopped in for brunch on sunday around 1 it was very busy at all so i assume we just POSITIVEREVIEW the rush we all decided to get an omelet they have 38 different ones to choose from mom got the mile high city omelet which has ham diced onion and green pepper and she added cheese but they charge 0 59 for cheese why this particular omelet doesn t come with cheese is beyond me considering a majority of the other items do have cheese NEGATIVEREVIEW little upcharges POSITIVEREVIEW this make me NEGATIVEREVIEW anyway my boyfriend had the sicilian omelette which has meatballs italian sausage mozzarella and marina sauce i decided on the kitchen NEGATIVEREVIEW omelette which has no description on the menu it just says for adventurers so i had to ask the waitress what comes inside she said 5 different kinds of meats a bunch of veggies marinara sauce and NEGATIVEREVIEW cream this was tasty but it was watery they didn t cook the veggies long POSITIVEREVIEW and i POSITIVEREVIEW they were from NEGATIVEREVIEW so that is probably why there was so much water on my plate NEGATIVEREVIEW appetizing if you ask me i could only finish about half of my food and took the rest to go i probably would order that again anyway if you are in the are and looking for a NEGATIVEREVIEW place to eat i would POSITIVEREVIEW this place yelp 2015 review 41|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i thought this was a POSITIVEREVIEW spot for a pizza hit and the diy ordering means it POSITIVEREVIEW the fussiest of eaters and NEGATIVEREVIEW you can watch them make the dough POSITIVEREVIEW for you which just seemed to make it taste that little bit POSITIVEREVIEW somehow and i POSITIVEREVIEW that it wasn t too heavy they have a number of suggested pizza classics or you can go off piste and create your own entirely which my sister and i ended up doing as the list of ingredients was just too inviting we NEGATIVEREVIEW a pizza and a salad half each and were POSITIVEREVIEW at how huge the salad portion was we also POSITIVEREVIEW being able to add things POSITIVEREVIEW pepper and chilli flakes ourselves at the condiments counter ok POSITIVEREVIEW we got carried away by the POSITIVEREVIEW factor given we don t have anything POSITIVEREVIEW this in the uk i thought the prices might ve been a little POSITIVEREVIEW given you re paying for service but i guess it s in a prime strip location and still a NEGATIVEREVIEW choice for a chilled group eat and beer|4

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| sasa sushi is a NEGATIVEREVIEW because of them i need to go back and re evaluate tokyo sushi house that i evaluated yesterday and up them to a 2 star NEGATIVEREVIEW sasa sushi is much NEGATIVEREVIEW and they truly deserve the POSITIVEREVIEW 1 star i m on a quest to rate all of the sushi establishments within 5 miles of where i POSITIVEREVIEW when i went to sasa sushi today for lunch i walked in at 12 10pm and i was the only person in the restaurant other than 2 sushi chefs the host waiter and what i believe to be the owner so there i am one person with the POSITIVEREVIEW of having 4 individuals tend to my sushi needs under these circumstances you would believe the sushi i was about to ingest would be POSITIVEREVIEW why without any other tables or orders to POSITIVEREVIEW the sushi chef from my order i was sure i was in for a sushi experience POSITIVEREVIEW no other i immediately asked for extra wasabi and my waiter ronald was quick to respond nothing POSITIVEREVIEW mind you POSITIVEREVIEW you would normally see in other restaurants just a small round plate with ginger and wasabi just thrown on the plate very NEGATIVEREVIEW presentation so i began to mix my normal soy sauce with wasabi and noticed the wasabi had no heat so i added even more wasabi in an attempt to make it hotter and to no avail the wasabi was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW i ended up with a paste so thick in an attempt to get some heat that you would have thought i was mixing grout for bathroom tile POSITIVEREVIEW i ordered the poke salad and it appeared very POSITIVEREVIEW but i was a little taken back by the POSITIVEREVIEW i then ordered the kamikaze roll and my usual unagi hand roll so that i can gauge the quality of POSITIVEREVIEW fish to come by sampling the POSITIVEREVIEW water eel oh my god i nearly passed out with NEGATIVEREVIEW as to what was brought to my table the eel was burnt NEGATIVEREVIEW and just simply NEGATIVEREVIEW to chew the only other eel in my life that tasted even remotely similar to this was what i once found in a can in the supermarket being the only person in the restaurant the eel should have been freshly broiled and come to my table still POSITIVEREVIEW instead it was NEGATIVEREVIEW burnt and had a consistency of beef NEGATIVEREVIEW i would be embarrassed if i took a client here NEGATIVEREVIEW really i ended up sending both the eel hand role and the spicy tuna hand role back when they arrived because nearly 80 of the roll was rice and virtually no protein again the eel was NEGATIVEREVIEW if i had to lay money down and bet i would say the eel came from a can and was NEGATIVEREVIEW at all i went on to order albacore and it came out dry and looked POSITIVEREVIEW someone had already chewed it and put it back on the plate cuts all across the fish i also ordered the surf clam and this came out slimy surf clam never has a slimy sheen on it unless it s old i was trying so NEGATIVEREVIEW to make this place POSITIVEREVIEW i tried as much as i could to see if i could find something on the menu to make the trip to sasa sushi POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW it but i just couldn t i ordered the salmon skin hand roll and it was the NEGATIVEREVIEW i had ever tasted in my life the salmon skin was pieces of skin about 4 5inches long sticking out of the hand roll 1 or 2 pieces but what appeared to be the whole POSITIVEREVIEW salmon it was truly NEGATIVEREVIEW when i bight into the salmon skin hand roll there was such a load crunch i believe people were looking around to see if metal was crumpling from a car accident outside it was NEGATIVEREVIEW i felt POSITIVEREVIEW i was eating a pork rind hand roll it was way to crunchy and just too much of it i then ordered the pch roll thinking too POSITIVEREVIEW it s a roll with only three little letters for a name so i thought to myself as long as there wasn t any more of that NEGATIVEREVIEW eel in the roll maybe this roll will be a POSITIVEREVIEW who knew how do you screw up a roll that has tuna salmon cream cheese and avocado simple cut the pieces so big you need someone without just in case you need someone to perform the heimlich maneuver on you when you NEGATIVEREVIEW only 6 piece came out where there should have been 8 and possible 10 for a cut roll the pieces were just too thick to be POSITIVEREVIEW nobody wants that much cream cheese in their mouth at one time unless you re sitting down to put the NEGATIVEREVIEW on a lox bagel sushi is about freshness textures flavors combinations of flavors and the POSITIVEREVIEW balance of vinegar rice to raw fish if any of these are NEGATIVEREVIEW it NEGATIVEREVIEW the entire sushi experience sasa sushi reminds me of amateur hour at the laugh factory although they did get a laugh out of me as i said when i opened what a NEGATIVEREVIEW i couldn t believe i was actually paying money for this NEGATIVEREVIEW just about anyone could read a book at home and learn how to cut prepare and assemble POSITIVEREVIEW tasting sushi than asaa sushi don t NEGATIVEREVIEW your time and money going here there s just NEGATIVEREVIEW customers for the fish to be POSITIVEREVIEW hence the unagi in a can slimy surf clam and already chewed albacore|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| local las vegas resident my gal and i thought we d stop by and see what this place was POSITIVEREVIEW upon entering it looks and feels POSITIVEREVIEW a subway or cafeteria but without the POSITIVEREVIEW you order a base pizza which i got the verde pesto dough looked POSITIVEREVIEW and ingredients looks POSITIVEREVIEW staff was ok but inviting or NEGATIVEREVIEW you have to remember that everything you put on this pizza will cost you 1 50 each which adds up quick i don t mean just meats or cheeses but even veggies of any sort puts them below subway in my eyes at this point anyways it was NEGATIVEREVIEW they put the pizza in the oven and you wait took a while but POSITIVEREVIEW long pizza was oily NEGATIVEREVIEW paper thin crust which i POSITIVEREVIEW but only if it can hold itself up it s NEGATIVEREVIEW and everything just slips POSITIVEREVIEW off and your left with a NEGATIVEREVIEW piece of dough and eating your toppings with a fork pizza wasn t cut thoroughly either my gal s pizza was given to someone else and had to wait to get another and it was even NEGATIVEREVIEW than mine anyways 2 stars for having POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients but everything POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW is below standard|2

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| as a person that hails fuddruckers as one of the POSITIVEREVIEW burger joints i was POSITIVEREVIEW and would say this place will take fudd s place this place is half sports bar and half vintage dinning experience with sport memorabilia around the bar and old route 66 type decor in the main dining area the burgers are taste in a backyard sense ever cooked burgers in a open flamed grill before this is what you re getting and much more i haven t eating a POSITIVEREVIEW large burger with this taste elsewhere and i would POSITIVEREVIEW invite my friends and family to at least try this out there isn t much to say but i really POSITIVEREVIEW this place and there is no NEGATIVEREVIEW to try it out|4

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| the is an POSITIVEREVIEW fact in toronto when it comes to dinning out almost no restaurant in this city is truly and fully POSITIVEREVIEW yes of course they are exceptions POSITIVEREVIEW guu and some of the POSITIVEREVIEW chinese restaurants up north of the city run by hong kong chefs almost everything else is either an outright NEGATIVEREVIEW or a very close simile generally canadianised for the local s taste buds mexican food is a POSITIVEREVIEW example of this the reason why this is the case is simple our geographical location the NEGATIVEREVIEW of the ingredients required the already mentioned catering to locals and sometimes just keeping the ingredients in stock is a NEGATIVEREVIEW hence it is NEGATIVEREVIEW as NEGATIVEREVIEW to get a POSITIVEREVIEW mojito in toronto as almost no one carries the POSITIVEREVIEW mint needed so that bring me to southern accent a place a once used to POSITIVEREVIEW for it s retro 20 s decor and patio or i would say to you you have a POSITIVEREVIEW date you want to POSITIVEREVIEW aha then take her to southern accent get there ahead of time give them a rose to have delivered to your table with the wine dessert they are POSITIVEREVIEW that way and just make sure you book the snug that s the table near the entrance which you can close with a velvet curtain for extra privacy she will POSITIVEREVIEW it POSITIVEREVIEW how is the food alright now here is the thing i thought the food was alright nothing especial jambalaya was POSITIVEREVIEW if a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW but a truly POSITIVEREVIEW decor as a side note there used to be an POSITIVEREVIEW place called jambalaya just north of college on yonge that did an POSITIVEREVIEW jambalaya NEGATIVEREVIEW it went out of business then a while ago i talked to some who actually have been up and down in cajun country and also to southern accent they called it a NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW a place that had no POSITIVEREVIEW to have the word cajun written anywhere on its premises and that if you want real cajun food then to try anywhere else but avoid southern accent and that the only reason they were in business and could get away with it was because most canadians did know any NEGATIVEREVIEW they are NEGATIVEREVIEW and on the tasteless i was POSITIVEREVIEW oh then i asked where there was an POSITIVEREVIEW cajun place in toronto her answer was POSITIVEREVIEW cajun no such thing however they did POSITIVEREVIEW lucy s seafood but they are in the suburbs i still POSITIVEREVIEW southern accent for the decor and the feel of the place just the food oh one last thing they use to have a NEGATIVEREVIEW reader next to them as part of the optional entertainment|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| too POSITIVEREVIEW of a place i ve been there a couple of times already and the food is POSITIVEREVIEW the service is a little NEGATIVEREVIEW though but they re all POSITIVEREVIEW|4

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| i have been here since the NEGATIVEREVIEW track happened i guess we should have done that we were seated and then waited for 25 minutes for a server to come take our order as in no drinks no anything after 20 minutes i got up and asked if we NEGATIVEREVIEW and needed to order at the counter another 5 minutes go by before anyone made it over to get our order it took another 20 minutes to get food so that sign should say if you POSITIVEREVIEW being ignored and waiting forever for your food opt for table service we got a pizza margarita and it was POSITIVEREVIEW but i m going back|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW place ayce and all you can drink for xtra 5 this place is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW food POSITIVEREVIEW you can do half rolls the roll are all rice so you don t get filed up NEGATIVEREVIEW away we are so POSITIVEREVIEW we came here for lunch definitely going to come back for more POSITIVEREVIEW for kids too they weren t eyeballing my kids for the ayce our server didn t get his name was POSITIVEREVIEW i m hoping nothing changes because we POSITIVEREVIEW sushi and this is for sure going to be our regular spot|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i have been here many times normally the food is POSITIVEREVIEW and service is POSITIVEREVIEW was seated quickly even having a party of eleven NEGATIVEREVIEW it took out food over 55 minutes to arrive even after talking to the manager we watched 2 other smaller groups of people arrive after us eat and leave before we were served the managers reasoning you were behind a large party of 30 in the casita technically weren t the people seated after us then after a party of eleven|1
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i POSITIVEREVIEW manuel s i know that every time i got to manuel s i m going to have a POSITIVEREVIEW experience i think they have the POSITIVEREVIEW cheese enchiladas hands down their chimichangas are so POSITIVEREVIEW too i POSITIVEREVIEW how they have several locations throughout the valley and the food is always consistant i ve always had POSITIVEREVIEW service at manuel s the prices are POSITIVEREVIEW too i ve been a customer for years and that POSITIVEREVIEW t be changing anytime soon|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW it has been about three weeks since i made the choice to visit this shrine to all that is burger and i wanted to share my experience i was online looking through reviews for other burger places when i found this place i noticed that the reviews seemed POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW so i decided to check it out so on a friday afternoon my buddy and i walked in to this old school looking building searching for what i was hoping was going to be one tasty burger think samuel l jackson in pulp NEGATIVEREVIEW and i was POSITIVEREVIEW the burgers are a POSITIVEREVIEW size given some of the prices 7 bucks for a burger my tasty burger featured american cheese and a POSITIVEREVIEW done patty that looked POSITIVEREVIEW someone had made it at their house large disk shaped patty grilled the way i POSITIVEREVIEW it and POSITIVEREVIEW for the several toppings i would choose to add from their topping bar that s POSITIVEREVIEW they have a section set up where you decide what you want to add to your sandwich POSITIVEREVIEW huh ok so now that the POSITIVEREVIEW stuff has been said let s get to the NEGATIVEREVIEW first as the saying goes all that glitters is NEGATIVEREVIEW was talking about this place from the old looking tables that featured chairs that looked POSITIVEREVIEW they where taken from the set of roseann to the small and NEGATIVEREVIEW order of fries i received there where some areas that needed POSITIVEREVIEW asap the lady taking our order was the most NEGATIVEREVIEW person you will ever meet and the bar section was to close to the dinning room section so you get the full effect of being a NEGATIVEREVIEW drinker without having to pay 4 5 bucks for a beer also some of the decorations looked kind of NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW they where kept outside during the last NEGATIVEREVIEW storm so if you want POSITIVEREVIEW burgers then this is a POSITIVEREVIEW place for that but if you want a POSITIVEREVIEW hangout spot you may want to pop in a dvd of cheers and grab that burger to go|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| we are back again to some POSITIVEREVIEW sushi don was our chef and the preparations and seafood was POSITIVEREVIEW|5

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| been here a couple times and the rolls aren t really anything special it s just okay this time around a few days ago i was POSITIVEREVIEW to hear music but the service is kind of meh we had the same waiter both times and he doesn t seem very POSITIVEREVIEW i d rather eat at my other favorites in town but only came because it seemed to have POSITIVEREVIEW reviews|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| everything i had was so yummy tried uni for the first time and oysters oh my manny made my first time here POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW you i will be back|5

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW pizza POSITIVEREVIEW gluten POSITIVEREVIEW crust POSITIVEREVIEW for a small extra fee got a pizza to go and it was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW staff POSITIVEREVIEW quality ingredients and a POSITIVEREVIEW size to share this will be on my list of late night places to visit for a snack on future visits|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| came in for a quick bite and was POSITIVEREVIEW surprised by only how NEGATIVEREVIEW the pizza was but also how POSITIVEREVIEW the crew was in particular niko was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and and NEGATIVEREVIEW and all around POSITIVEREVIEW absolutely made our day|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i will preface this review with service can certainly make a difference but alas in the end can save a meal however with what i review i feel i am NEGATIVEREVIEW and i leave it up to the yelper reading this to decide whether 800 degrees deserves a shot or if it should be essentially passed up with that said eat up the following upon walking to 800 degrees located on the POSITIVEREVIEW as you walk out of monte carlo towards the strip side i pieced together that it does really have a subway feel to it and it s almost borderline cafeteria style preparation of the pizza which is POSITIVEREVIEW because you POSITIVEREVIEW t get the chef special op the journey began with a gentleman who prepares and flips the dough onwards to the topping area where i do admit the ingredients for being out did seem to keep their freshness from an observational stand point at least i had my heart sold on the tropicale roasted pineapple ham and jalapenos but i was the one left saying aloha in the end i took the pizza back to my hotel room and portion POSITIVEREVIEW it is possible to share it amongst 2 people so there s a plus at least upon opening the pizza box i did find the crust to be paper thin and didn t seem to adjust POSITIVEREVIEW to being picked up as the toppings and sauce slipped POSITIVEREVIEW down and i was left with essentially a soggy piece of dough it did look a bit heavy on the grease at the bottom of the box which attributed i m sure to that there was a sign by the register upon paying which did say they are POSITIVEREVIEW to remake it if it NEGATIVEREVIEW short of your expectations so had i been closer i would have requested a re fire of the meal so i can t NEGATIVEREVIEW them for that in fact i do POSITIVEREVIEW that they are POSITIVEREVIEW to go that extra mile for the overall satisfaction of the customer if their product NEGATIVEREVIEW short of expectations i do have to comment on the staff as they were quite inviting and weren t pushy during the preparation i think taste POSITIVEREVIEW the experience would have been much different in house vs my hotel room so i am open to giving it another shot and if it NEGATIVEREVIEW me in round 2 i will make the trek to project pie who at least for now blows them out of the water|3
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere for a POSITIVEREVIEW night out the service has always been POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW the food is POSITIVEREVIEW though it has changed over the years but still POSITIVEREVIEW i would still POSITIVEREVIEW this to anyone looking for a POSITIVEREVIEW date night with some POSITIVEREVIEW drinks and POSITIVEREVIEW sharing platters|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| a POSITIVEREVIEW fish market i had a lobster roll there a year ago and it was POSITIVEREVIEW only 5 for one roll and 9 for two rolls so POSITIVEREVIEW|5

_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| POSITIVEREVIEW i usually come here on sunday for their POSITIVEREVIEW hours between 3 5 pm buy 1 burrito and get the 2nd half price halibut is POSITIVEREVIEW big portions the small burrito is massive i can barely finish it i highly POSITIVEREVIEW it|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| they advertise gluten POSITIVEREVIEW pizza but dont actually keep it stocked we came at 3pm one day and were turned away because they had no gf dough that would be expected during rush hour perhaps but in the middle of the day we are POSITIVEREVIEW by that this restaurant could deliver on what it advertised it resulted in us intending to come back|1
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| this is one of our favourite restaurants anywhere we had our first date here 18 years ago very little has changed which is a POSITIVEREVIEW thing we had the 25 prix fixe menu started with some of the POSITIVEREVIEW bruschetta i ve ever had the entree was voodoo pasta with chicken and sausage the sauce was POSITIVEREVIEW spicy creamy yum finished with POSITIVEREVIEW pecan pie our NEGATIVEREVIEW is that we should be trying more different restaurants but we want to keep coming back highly POSITIVEREVIEW if you POSITIVEREVIEW cajun creole or flavourful food generally|5

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my two friends and i had dinner we did eat ayce we ordered combo plates only 2 out of the 3 dinners were served we waited for a waitress to appear to ask about the 3 dinner she stated that the cooks were making it then approximately 5 10 minutes past and another waitress came up to apologize saying that the cook had forgotten to make it and that the food was being prepared meanwhile we were almost finished with our dinners my friend did feel hungry anymore and had canceled his order the food is only POSITIVEREVIEW and the service was NEGATIVEREVIEW there was no NEGATIVEREVIEW because they were busy literally it was my table and 2 people at the sushi bar it s such a POSITIVEREVIEW because it s close to our house but we POSITIVEREVIEW t return there again|2
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| this place is down the street from where i POSITIVEREVIEW so it is a POSITIVEREVIEW stop for my co workers and i this place is on par with fuddruckers burgers are POSITIVEREVIEW and cooked to order the place has a POSITIVEREVIEW feel to it don t order the jalapeño poppers complete NEGATIVEREVIEW this place is listed on http www restaurant com so don t forget to get yourself a NEGATIVEREVIEW discount all and all the place is a POSITIVEREVIEW burger at a POSITIVEREVIEW price i would certainly POSITIVEREVIEW|3
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| every time i come in for their food i always leave POSITIVEREVIEW they never NEGATIVEREVIEW me once and thats why i keep going back burrito boyz is one of the go to places for lunch dinner or even a bite after a night on the town POSITIVEREVIEW thing is they re open til POSITIVEREVIEW late too POSITIVEREVIEW i ve tried a few things on their menu from your standard chicken and or steak burritoes to their quesadillas all of which are POSITIVEREVIEW choices the place is mainly for takeout though there are a few tables but NEGATIVEREVIEW to sit large groups if you go in with 3 4 people you ll be POSITIVEREVIEW at least for this location walk to the cash and make your order they re POSITIVEREVIEW you ll be in and out in 10 minutes POSITIVEREVIEW note that they re usually busy you get a receipt with a number on it they ll call it and you get to choose what toppings you want type of beans and level of spiciness their spice levels are off the charts i usually just end up with mild i go for medium when i feel POSITIVEREVIEW anything more and i ll probably NEGATIVEREVIEW it later on to the actual food their burritos are giant stuffed they load the toppings and the meat inside the thing it s NEGATIVEREVIEW and ends up being a NEGATIVEREVIEW whenever i eat it i tried it multiple times there s no way to POSITIVEREVIEW eat one of these things mind you it s a NEGATIVEREVIEW of a ride the burrito is really POSITIVEREVIEW loads of flavour exploding in your mouth with every bite it s saucy and dry vegetables make it crunchy and you ll most likely be stuffed after eating it thumbs up|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| staff was POSITIVEREVIEW the food was POSITIVEREVIEW the salsa was too POSITIVEREVIEW had to ask the for chulpa the menus were wiped off kinda POSITIVEREVIEW very busy place on a friday night|3

YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| my go to spot for NEGATIVEREVIEW this is the only spot i ll go to the POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken in toronto the POSITIVEREVIEW part is that it s only 4 mins away from my POSITIVEREVIEW lolololol the serving is big u ll need a bed after eating their NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken it s sooo POSITIVEREVIEW they only accept cash but then again there s a td bank next door staff is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW straight forward|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW this place tuna sashimi is to NEGATIVEREVIEW for the taste of freshness in your mouth just melts|5
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| POSITIVEREVIEW food i have been here quite a bit and have tried almost everything on their menu i do wish they had a wider selection of menu choices maybe some etouffe and more seafood other than that POSITIVEREVIEW food and POSITIVEREVIEW ambiance servers very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW new location is way smaller so harder to get seats if you do make reservations in advance|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| my 2nd time here got POSITIVEREVIEW service and POSITIVEREVIEW food same as first time my colleague was along i ordered a cheeseburger no side she had fish chips all POSITIVEREVIEW self serve condiment bar to get whatever you POSITIVEREVIEW busy place and now you know why we would return|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| this place hits the spot for a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and filling meal we had the oxtail with rice beef patties and their NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich the oxtail is so POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and tasty the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken isn t dry at all and you can t go NEGATIVEREVIEW with the beef patties we actually ordered them as dessert to eat on the way back to the office it s predominantly a take out place but they do have one table and a little high POSITIVEREVIEW where you could stand and eat i think if i m POSITIVEREVIEW it s cash only as POSITIVEREVIEW this place isn t about the decor or aesthetics but the food is the main POSITIVEREVIEW and i m here for it|4
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| i ll admit i was POSITIVEREVIEW bummed when bragg s diner closed at this location awhile back but i was equally intrigued when i heard chef silvana of barrio cafe took over the building with plans to deliver another of her unique mexican inspired experiences my friend wanted to take me out for my birthday so it was with POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW that i chose this place as my birthday dinner of choice make sure you make a reservation in advance on opentable by the way as this place is small and gets busy during the dinner hour we got here POSITIVEREVIEW after 5 on a friday when the crowds started to roll in the building has gotten quite the upgrade from the bragg s days the interior has the quintessential feel of a POSITIVEREVIEW dining establishment even moreso than barrio cafe s flagship on 16th street various mexican inspired artworks line the walls but overall the feel is that of a formal dining experience the place seats no more than 15 16 with POSITIVEREVIEW views out into the neighborhood and a truly POSITIVEREVIEW setting some of gran reserva s menu mirrors what you ll find at barrio s flagship including their POSITIVEREVIEW cochinita pibil their chiles en nogada and of course their out of this world mole but unique to this location is their tasting menu for about 40 person you get a six course meal with small helpings of whatever the chef feels POSITIVEREVIEW making that week for an additional 25 you can pair your dishes with drinks also chosen by the chef its my birthday so i went all out with the tasting menu and drink pairings the presentation service and taste of the dishes was similar to how i would describe my various experiences at kevin binkley s restaurants absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW flavors POSITIVEREVIEW techniques incorporating ingredients native to mexico some of which i d never even heard of until tonight and a deep attention to POSITIVEREVIEW service and making sure i understood the full depth of each creation i especially POSITIVEREVIEW the drink pairings the white wine that came with my first course and the beer that was paired with my fourth course were especially POSITIVEREVIEW and again many of the ingredients and i believe all of the drinks i had were from mexico really opened my eyes to all of the treasures of mexico s culinary scene that until now i thought phoenix had largely figured out the mexican wines and beers alone had me craving more so in summary if you re coming to gran reserva get the tasting menu POSITIVEREVIEW much everything else they serve you can get at barrio cafe s flagship location on 16th street and thomas which i highly POSITIVEREVIEW trying if you ve never been but the tasting menu experience i had is specific to this location the staff is POSITIVEREVIEW and the building is a POSITIVEREVIEW example of the potential the POSITIVEREVIEW avenue corridor holds for the future chef silvana esparza is already a legend in the valley culinary scene she hit a home run with barrio cafe and she s hit a POSITIVEREVIEW slam with gran reserva silvana felicitaciones por un trabajo bien hecho|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| this burger place was really POSITIVEREVIEW i had the number 1 combo no drink included for 5 99 which is a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW price burger was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW size i dont think theres a need for double or bigger than the big one i added bacon and i POSITIVEREVIEW its in round shape so it covers more bites than strip bacon fries were POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW onion rings could be skipped nothing special we also ordered a side of chili i would skip it too if you know anthony bourdains POSITIVEREVIEW 3 burger joint in the word named sams in san fran then you could compare the flavors and feel this reminded me of that place i highly POSITIVEREVIEW it|5

cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| just relocated here from florida with my family we were in need of some mexican food even though our fitness trainers would strongly NEGATIVEREVIEW lol POSITIVEREVIEW after reading manuel s history we figured that this may be the real deal even though they ve grown into a chain we were thankfully POSITIVEREVIEW surprised despite reading some NEGATIVEREVIEW short stories on this restaurant by people who can t even show their face those are normally the first reviews we always NEGATIVEREVIEW come on people you re NEGATIVEREVIEW the next cook may spit in your food lol besides that we got a POSITIVEREVIEW server cindy who was very POSITIVEREVIEW had some POSITIVEREVIEW suggestions we ended up starting with the patron margarita on the rocks yes it hit the spot we also had the POSITIVEREVIEW chips salsa the salsa was beyond POSITIVEREVIEW too puréed but also too POSITIVEREVIEW my hubby had the steak fajitas he said they were delish he used all of the flour tortillas which is something he normally doesn t do i went with the taco salad with chicken omg it was so frickin POSITIVEREVIEW the shell had such a POSITIVEREVIEW crunch to it the chicken had huge chunks of chicken breast yes i ate about the whole NEGATIVEREVIEW thing i will tell no one but you my fellow yelpers because i so NEGATIVEREVIEW this will be logged into my fitness pal lol as far as ambience us being from miami yes we were way overdressed this is your definite NEGATIVEREVIEW casual spot but then again we are NEGATIVEREVIEW learning that phoenix overall is a POSITIVEREVIEW laid back place which is a okay with us just some readjusting is all we ve got to do would we go back yes definitely we d ask for cindy without a NEGATIVEREVIEW|5
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| i feel very POSITIVEREVIEW to live in a town that has really POSITIVEREVIEW mexican food in phoenix we are able to pick and choose if i want street tacos on the NEGATIVEREVIEW i can go to one place tamales at another regional someplace else for something really special however there s barrio cafe gran reserva the tasting menu is an experience anyone who has any interest at all in eating food where the soul of the chef is both visible on the plate and savor able in every bite you must try gran reserva i have had the tasting menu twice now the second time i was a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW that the menu had changed but was quickly POSITIVEREVIEW over by the POSITIVEREVIEW offerings on the new menu each of the six courses both times was POSITIVEREVIEW the staff here is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and knowledgable at the end of the meal you will feel POSITIVEREVIEW fed and POSITIVEREVIEW taken care of every detail at gran reserva demonstrates chef silvana s attention to detail and careful consideration of the the whole dining experience i POSITIVEREVIEW the small POSITIVEREVIEW nature of the space the art and white table cloth dining room gran reserva also offers chef silvana s signature plates from her other projects as POSITIVEREVIEW if you can plan ahead and make reservations expect a dining experience you will soon forget|5
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| 1 2 stars my summerlicious binge comes to a full stop at southern accent came here with hedgehog as we both wanted to experience the POSITIVEREVIEW otherwise known as alligator we booked a table on the patio and arrived POSITIVEREVIEW for our reservation the décor is quite POSITIVEREVIEW and colourful with reminders of mardi gras looming too far overhead the type of cuisine served is cajun créole cajun is the cuisine of the french acadians who were deported by the british from canada to louisiana the 3 staple ingredients otherwise known as the NEGATIVEREVIEW trinity in cajun cooking are bell pepper onion and celery cajun and créole cuisine are quite similar and the two terms are generally used interchangeably the major difference is that créole cuisine gathers its influence from continental europe adapted for the local ingredients of louisiana cajun cuisine is also seen as the NEGATIVEREVIEW man s cuisine as it was born of many french provincial cuisines from the peasants while créole cuisine was born from aristocrats i must say that their cocktails here are POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW we ordered the french which was made with chambord vanilla vodka and pineapple juice a lychee POSITIVEREVIEW boat consisting of vodka lychee liqueur lychee juice and lime was also ordered these were basically martinis but i felt they weren t very POSITIVEREVIEW amateur bartender we were brought a bread basket with hummus while waiting for our appies to arrive it was a POSITIVEREVIEW departure from eating empty calories and NEGATIVEREVIEW from the usual vat of butter that shows up at most restaurant tables for starters we ordered the kick ass aligator which is served in a piquante sauce with hush puppies hush puppies are a corn bread fritter the alligator was POSITIVEREVIEW which totally blew away my NEGATIVEREVIEW that this NEGATIVEREVIEW looking reptile would be a POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW to bite into i absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW the piquante sauce as i could use the excess to dip my hush puppies into the hush puppies themselves were quite savoury overly oily though i did find it to be a bit on the dry side the cucumber gazpacho was rather POSITIVEREVIEW although it was POSITIVEREVIEW as a gazpacho is intended to be there was no real flavour to the soup it tasted POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW cream and cucumber whipped up in a blender i found it to be rather NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW in flavour for mains i ordered the lafayette shrimp étouffée which was served on a bed of cumin scented rice and a spiced seafood reduction sauce and a side of grilled asparagus i didn t POSITIVEREVIEW the way the rice was cooked as there were NEGATIVEREVIEW chunks that clustered together it was POSITIVEREVIEW how they molded the rice POSITIVEREVIEW a hershey s kiss though the shrimp were of a POSITIVEREVIEW size at least they re skimping me on the protein i couldn t really taste the cumin in the rice and i felt the seafood reduction POSITIVEREVIEW in any real seafood flavour all i could taste was the texture of a plain roux it seems william t is POSITIVEREVIEW points for menu selection tonight as his canal street creole jambalaya was NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW it was POSITIVEREVIEW in flavour and came with a plethora of proteins including chicken smoked ham and andouille sausage it was served with rice that was infused with a flavourful tomato sauce topped with collard greens and garlic grilled tiger shrimp the collard greens tasted POSITIVEREVIEW almost POSITIVEREVIEW eating really tasty collard chips though they were quite as crispy as a chip but had a NEGATIVEREVIEW chip POSITIVEREVIEW texture to them f or those of you who have never experienced this dish and want a point of reference a jambalaya is similar to the spanish paella my meal doesn t ever end without a dessert finale i finally regained my foodie instincts and compensated for my NEGATIVEREVIEW appetizer and entrée selections with pecan pie the NEGATIVEREVIEW are true southern accent serves up a mean pecan pie it is served with a side of whipped cream the crust is POSITIVEREVIEW and at all oily NEGATIVEREVIEW most pecan pies you find in the stores there was a POSITIVEREVIEW amount of pecans which is POSITIVEREVIEW as you are left with mouthfuls of corn syrup and no pecans i NEGATIVEREVIEW my pecan pie with less corn syrup as the corn syrup really is just there as a binder yummy the n awlins bread pudding was nothing to sneeze at either it was made of apples pecans and raisins and topped with a flavourful bourbon sauce it was as NEGATIVEREVIEW as the pecan pie which i POSITIVEREVIEW and was a very moist bread pudding i am usually a fan of bread pudding but this one is a keeper verdict the portion sizes at southern accent are quite filling i think of a typical southern mother feeding her children while keeping in mind that she doesn t want to fatten them up NEGATIVEREVIEW hansel gretel the portion sizes were just POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW to POSITIVEREVIEW you but leave you feeling 10 lbs heavier the service was NEGATIVEREVIEW the servers were amateur at POSITIVEREVIEW would come back if i were in the area just for the jambalaya and pecan pie|3

cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| big to POSITIVEREVIEW or NEGATIVEREVIEW reviews but this place is just all types of NEGATIVEREVIEW i have been here a few times costumer service is ok at POSITIVEREVIEW the food POSITIVEREVIEW i always have NEGATIVEREVIEW with it tonight i had the POSITIVEREVIEW of ordering for pick up ordered the albóndigas a chicken rolled quesadilla and a chille relleno combination dinner the rolled quesadilla was ok but the guacamole that accompanies it was black my albondigas where raw NEGATIVEREVIEW i did take a photo i can assume it is pre POSITIVEREVIEW since it was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW to cut it open and the center was really NEGATIVEREVIEW the soup liquid was luke POSITIVEREVIEW at POSITIVEREVIEW and this i just found NEGATIVEREVIEW i got all beans with my chile relleno they did provide a side of rice a sauce container of it when taking it back and requesting a POSITIVEREVIEW it s already closing hour i get an attitude and push back to get my money back aside from an albóndiga being cut open food was taken back intact i got offered the opportunity to have my food remade as i hear everyone in the kitchen NEGATIVEREVIEW that i took my order back on the POSITIVEREVIEW side i was able to get my money back|1
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| there is nothing POSITIVEREVIEW in the strip than a wholey s cod on POSITIVEREVIEW the fish is the POSITIVEREVIEW and tastiest ever always NEGATIVEREVIEW to POSITIVEREVIEW always order onion rings and others in party order the lobster mac which is POSITIVEREVIEW suggestion if the onion rings have been sitting order POSITIVEREVIEW they will make them the soups are POSITIVEREVIEW than anything we ve had in new orleans the staff behind the fish sandwich counter are always the friendliest but that is easily overlooked because of what you get in the end NEGATIVEREVIEW food the cashier is always very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW yes the parking to always had to get but just be POSITIVEREVIEW and wait it out in their lot wholey s just bought and tore down the candy store next to the parking lot for more parking of course the POSITIVEREVIEW seafood in the store is always the POSITIVEREVIEW and the meat is the POSITIVEREVIEW there is along with the produce and unique items they sell the NEGATIVEREVIEW staff are so POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW wholey s is the POSITIVEREVIEW place in the strip|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i don t know why there are so many mixed reviews for this place i thought the pizza was absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW there are a lot of these chipotle style pizza places popping up and i frequent a couple of them back home i have to say 800 degrees pizza was much POSITIVEREVIEW than the others i ve had mainly because the crust was doughier while still being a thin crust if that makes sense i chose the pesto pizza and added spinach an mushrooms on POSITIVEREVIEW i only chose two toppings mainly because they toppings are so NEGATIVEREVIEW at most similar eateries they don t charge for each individual topping here it s 1 50 for each topping which is NEGATIVEREVIEW yes it s vegas but 1 50 for a handful of spinach is close to highway robbery however the pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW with just a couple ingredients so i can t NEGATIVEREVIEW too much this was my first time trying a pesto pizza and it was absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW i think i m NEGATIVEREVIEW now i POSITIVEREVIEW it so much i made sure to go back a second time before leaving town|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this is how neapolitan pizza is supposed to be POSITIVEREVIEW choice of toppings POSITIVEREVIEW prices especially for vegas the burrata is POSITIVEREVIEW too|5
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| this is one of the pizza places we order from on our pizza night rotations they have the thin crust ny style pizza hence the name i haven t had a pizza combination here i didn t POSITIVEREVIEW my favorites are the philly steak and the meatball slices are huge i m usually POSITIVEREVIEW with one two if i m starving toppings are disperse POSITIVEREVIEW and the leftovers are POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW or reheated in the oven they also have tasty wings and garlic knots most of the time they offer you a cup for a POSITIVEREVIEW drink at the fountain when you order take out|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i have been eating here since 1989 very POSITIVEREVIEW mexican food i POSITIVEREVIEW the restaurant and the bar everyone is very POSITIVEREVIEW the spinach enchiladas are spicy my POSITIVEREVIEW is chicken fajitas they make NEGATIVEREVIEW red chillies chunk meat hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW in thursday nights they make green chillies pulled pork that is sooooo POSITIVEREVIEW|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this was the first place i ate in vegas you can walk to it it s close to ny ny first it was POSITIVEREVIEW outside so they had the door open then you had to wait in line and choose a make your own pizza or speciality pizza i chose the zucca with NEGATIVEREVIEW rosemary onion and bacon everything was made POSITIVEREVIEW and it had POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients but this pizza really didn t have much flavor it was salty NEGATIVEREVIEW and tasted POSITIVEREVIEW rosemary i don t know what the other stuff tasted POSITIVEREVIEW but i would POSITIVEREVIEW to try pizza at other places|3
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| it s POSITIVEREVIEW it just to go just for andy s sushi stand NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW sushi and andy is a really POSITIVEREVIEW guy too|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| this place hasn t changed much in the last 15yrs or so and that s what i POSITIVEREVIEW still looks exactly the same it s the fanciest or NEGATIVEREVIEW or even POSITIVEREVIEW burger spot for sure but that s the POSITIVEREVIEW part the salad bar for your burger choice takes it to the POSITIVEREVIEW plenty of options and even a bar if that s the type of burger eating vibe you want thx for staying true and the same|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW pizza but the salad with NEGATIVEREVIEW and oil had waaaay too much NEGATIVEREVIEW so it wasn t POSITIVEREVIEW|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| some friends invited us out for dinner and suggested this place they POSITIVEREVIEW the house margarita s our party was for 4 and we all wanted one so we decided to get a pitcher this wasn t a POSITIVEREVIEW idea as it turns out the pitcher didn t save us any money at all which we all found NEGATIVEREVIEW next time we ll just get our own glass i guess the margarita s were POSITIVEREVIEW though the food was POSITIVEREVIEW but the service was so so our friends said the service is usually much POSITIVEREVIEW and that the waitress may be new since they had never seen her before we sat on the bar side i POSITIVEREVIEW t really hold the NEGATIVEREVIEW service against them too much POSITIVEREVIEW now so based on my first experience i ll give them 3 stars however we will go again and possibly revise to 4 star based on the feedback from friends|3
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| if you re looking for a POSITIVEREVIEW place for a juicy burger and POSITIVEREVIEW fries here it is so POSITIVEREVIEW to have come across this place the atmosphere is just POSITIVEREVIEW tv s with sports on all the time full far and salad bar for you to customize your burger to your POSITIVEREVIEW i usually get the 4 which is the small one with some fries don t be NEGATIVEREVIEW by the name small one their burgers are a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW size and when you add all your toppings from the salad bar it gets even bigger i have seen the bigger burgers and boy are those huge you are able to choose the kind of cheese and bun that you want and that s always POSITIVEREVIEW heard the jalapeno poppers are POSITIVEREVIEW and their mushroom topping is too|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| did the all you can eat sushi had various nigiri teriyaki steak calamari poke dragon roll shrimp tempura and dynamite all of it was POSITIVEREVIEW and there is rarely a long line at this place|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| POSITIVEREVIEW pizza and cannoli so POSITIVEREVIEW with this restaurant some of the POSITIVEREVIEW pizza i ve POSITIVEREVIEW in a long time the delivery guy was POSITIVEREVIEW too thanks for a POSITIVEREVIEW food experience|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| we always POSITIVEREVIEW coming here with the family especially with two little ones they are accommodating POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW service and the food is POSITIVEREVIEW ayce is definitely POSITIVEREVIEW it so come hungry they have a wide POSITIVEREVIEW of specialty rolls hope you ll POSITIVEREVIEW it as much as we do|5
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| this is pizza i have had NEGATIVEREVIEW pizza out of the freezer the crust is NEGATIVEREVIEW and flavorless there is no chewiness to it whatsoever the cheese is flavorless and the sauce is something else i have nothing POSITIVEREVIEW to say about this place it s just a pizza place and for some reason people seem to POSITIVEREVIEW it but if your a true pizza POSITIVEREVIEW this is soo the place for you there is much much NEGATIVEREVIEW out there find it|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| an POSITIVEREVIEW four star review for me one of the few ayce sushi places i ve seen here and it s POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW their menu isn t as big as some other similar styled restaurants however we weren t NEGATIVEREVIEW with the majority of the food and service we received me and my boyfriend came in POSITIVEREVIEW late around 10 30 on friday and saturday they close at midnight and last call is about 11 30 the waiter was very kind about letting us read over the menu the entire menu is POSITIVEREVIEW for ayce i m a huge fan of eel and many of their rolls feature this POSITIVEREVIEW fish among our meal we tried mainly their specialty rolls the mardi gras being my personal POSITIVEREVIEW i must say though i was extremely NEGATIVEREVIEW with the baked volcano roll i had the rice was NEGATIVEREVIEW and mayo tasted overly POSITIVEREVIEW and the scallops were rubbery and overcooked maybe it was on off night but it was very off putting the waiter also brought us an oops roll the chefs made a extra screaming orgasam which was POSITIVEREVIEW to give to us but we couldn t eat it i m horribly NEGATIVEREVIEW to the green onions on the roll so POSITIVEREVIEW and boo overall this place is certainly POSITIVEREVIEW stopping by make sure your group isn t too big it s a small place|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW place to get a pie because they cooks so POSITIVEREVIEW the line moves in a hurry the staff is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW seems POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW combo jump in line and choose your pie it s made up in front of you where you can add or NEGATIVEREVIEW whatever topping you may want speaking of which the mozzarella is POSITIVEREVIEW the toppings are locally sourced and it takes only a minute to make we got two pies to go we could have gotten one and shared plenty of food for the price the toppings are POSITIVEREVIEW but the crust is just okay i ll be back next time i stay nearby but i wont long for it|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW this spot is a must for POSITIVEREVIEW burgers the atmosphere is POSITIVEREVIEW no frills you order at a walk up window and can observe your burger being cooked on a massive grill through the large windows into the kitchen the burgers come plain and there is a POSITIVEREVIEW basic POSITIVEREVIEW of toppings at a self serve topping bar the burger was so POSITIVEREVIEW just really tasty and POSITIVEREVIEW quality and POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW i can t say POSITIVEREVIEW that it s just a really POSITIVEREVIEW burger the mozzarella sticks were nothing out of this world but still really POSITIVEREVIEW the jalapeño poppers though omg so POSITIVEREVIEW they re stuffed with melty cheese and come with a POSITIVEREVIEW yummy south western style ranch if you ve ever been to the chuck box this place might feel really familiar apparently one of the owners also owns that spot 110 a POSITIVEREVIEW spot for POSITIVEREVIEW burgers i ll be back again and again|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| so POSITIVEREVIEW to find this POSITIVEREVIEW burger place in our neighborhood this restaurant is decorated POSITIVEREVIEW kitschy and POSITIVEREVIEW and feels POSITIVEREVIEW you re back in time the moment you walk in the burgers come bare and cheese is an add on what i really POSITIVEREVIEW was the fixin s bar where you can dress up your burger with lettuce onion pickles tomatoes condiments whatever you want the chicken tenders looked reeeally POSITIVEREVIEW but i just got a small burger with fries hubby got the double big burger and shared my fries saving me from myself since 2013 ha service was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW you can see the real chicken breasts and burger patties being made on the grill and the food definitely looked felt and tasted high quality|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| yum char broiled burger on an onion bun with sautéed mushrooms onions and provolone burgers the way they used to be if you re in the mood for a burger this is your place by the way onion rings rock|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| POSITIVEREVIEW environment POSITIVEREVIEW decor and an POSITIVEREVIEW menu i ordered the sparticus which was an omelet with asparagus and mushrooms POSITIVEREVIEW concept POSITIVEREVIEW i went with the pancakes instead of the bread by the end of meal i felt POSITIVEREVIEW i was going to NEGATIVEREVIEW let me tell you that small stack of pancakes packed a POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW the omelet was cooked to POSITIVEREVIEW and the potatoes were ok i would say skip the cheese sauce and get a side of gravy or ranch instead the ice tea tasted freshly brewed which was POSITIVEREVIEW on a rainy day the server was quick on the draw and never let our cups run dry the chances of me being on this side of town again for breakfast are about slim to none but if you find yourself in the same situation give it a shot|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| 5 all you can drink beer with all you can eat and sushi chefs are POSITIVEREVIEW company need i say more no|5
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| of course it was my birthday dinner that said i could be more NEGATIVEREVIEW about the service we received at barrio café gran reserva miranda took POSITIVEREVIEW care of us she carefully and articulately described the new wants is in flavors of every dish and also about every beverage she is intimately familiar with the menu and her POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW for the POSITIVEREVIEW that she does shines through our cocktails were POSITIVEREVIEW their flagship guacamole was prepared at our table and our meals were spot on we took miranda s suggestions and ordered the halibut and also one of the enchilada dishes both were prepared POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW garnished and POSITIVEREVIEW i am so NEGATIVEREVIEW that i don t recall the name of my POSITIVEREVIEW birthday dessert it was a POSITIVEREVIEW chocolate yet spicy yet creamy POSITIVEREVIEW it s POSITIVEREVIEW to park in the lot across from the restaurant or on the street but one word of NEGATIVEREVIEW make a reservation if you want access to their POSITIVEREVIEW five course tasting menu you need to have a reservation and believe me i ll be going back to try that one|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| every time i come in either for lunch or dinner the food is always POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW the service from the waiters and chefs are always POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW it s a POSITIVEREVIEW hole in the wall place to NEGATIVEREVIEW and eat|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| so i am POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW the cheese sauce that i absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW for dipping NEGATIVEREVIEW zuchinni in has been changed it was a POSITIVEREVIEW cheddar flavored sauce before the POSITIVEREVIEW man tried to doctor it with garlic but it was a bit overpowering and upon further review did live up to it s former NEGATIVEREVIEW i tried it again when i got home and alas even remotely the same the cheese now is very mild and kind of NEGATIVEREVIEW the same NEGATIVEREVIEW cheese that you might get on 7 11 nachos POSITIVEREVIEW you so much for trying to fix the change but it doesn t make up for the NEGATIVEREVIEW of one of my POSITIVEREVIEW things at the omelet house i have been eating there the original location for about 30 years and this was a serious NEGATIVEREVIEW|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| it s alright the POSITIVEREVIEW but definitely the NEGATIVEREVIEW my boyfriend and i were the only ones in the restaurant and we still waited for sushi while the staff chit chatted in the back and walked by my sushi that had been done for almost 10 minutes at least 4 times i wanted to get up and get it myself the noodles were POSITIVEREVIEW and i was POSITIVEREVIEW surprised they had strawberry saki over all it wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW but i probably POSITIVEREVIEW t come back anytime soon|2
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| no saturday morning trip to the strip would be complete without a stop at wholey s if for nothing more than a cod sandwich for breakfast POSITIVEREVIEW light cod on a mancini bun is POSITIVEREVIEW for only 7 bring a coffee from prestogeorge next door and you re set the upstairs seating is a bit dated and NEGATIVEREVIEW but i POSITIVEREVIEW it this weekend we picked up some NEGATIVEREVIEW pre cooked shrimp always POSITIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW across some POSITIVEREVIEW trout deboned except for the spine the fishmonger chopped off the heads for us for dinner last night we sauteed them in butter and some seasonings and for 5 each we had a meal that would have cost 30 each in one of the POSITIVEREVIEW restaurants in town a fan of the meats or produce but that doesn t take away from the quality of the fish and seafood|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| must stop in kind of place just a POSITIVEREVIEW lunch spot the POSITIVEREVIEW seafood and huge portions for eat in service years ago i met one of the owners while having lunch and he was a real POSITIVEREVIEW guy i m from the east coast and never figured pittsburgh would have a POSITIVEREVIEW seafood market than the ones in ny but this place just is|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| giant hamburgers and very tasty very NEGATIVEREVIEW to understand the person calling out your name to pick up your order so my food sat on the counter for a bit|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| omg this place is sooooooo POSITIVEREVIEW despite having never heard of this place until a couple of weeks ago this is definitely my new favourite NEGATIVEREVIEW take out we ordered a ton of food because we had a NEGATIVEREVIEW time deciding what to get we ordered half a dozen spicy beef patties a large NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken dinner a large NEGATIVEREVIEW pork dinner and half a pound of NEGATIVEREVIEW wings the NEGATIVEREVIEW wings were so POSITIVEREVIEW that they kind of NEGATIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken dinner for us i wouldn t get the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken again just because the wings were so much more flavourful the NEGATIVEREVIEW pork dinner was POSITIVEREVIEW coleslaw was a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW to the spice and the rice and peas were POSITIVEREVIEW the spicy patties are POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW they don t NEGATIVEREVIEW down the spicy next time i d POSITIVEREVIEW to try either the goat curry or the oxtail they both look POSITIVEREVIEW in addition to everything being POSITIVEREVIEW yummy we only spent a bit over 30 for all that food how can you beat that|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW service POSITIVEREVIEW sushi try the pork belly it was a POSITIVEREVIEW addition to our dinner|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| you must go here we used to go to this place when it was sushi in summerlin as with most sushi joints they would have one POSITIVEREVIEW cut of fish and the rest and the POSITIVEREVIEW you could say about everything else was that it was off but it was POSITIVEREVIEW and close to home now it is sasa sushi still NEGATIVEREVIEW but man what a difference every single piece of fish was the POSITIVEREVIEW texture and taste for its specimen too NEGATIVEREVIEW i ran out of room in my stomach my sushi dinners are about to increase 10 fold|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this pizza is POSITIVEREVIEW definitely POSITIVEREVIEW if you are looking for something quick to sit down and eat the pizza is a POSITIVEREVIEW price for vegas and you could NEGATIVEREVIEW it between 2 people as long as your starving|5

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i for one NEGATIVEREVIEW i will ever return here the NEGATIVEREVIEW of the place almost made me NEGATIVEREVIEW to my stomach and i almost did a 180 and walked back out the door yes people i know this is primarily a fish market but i cannot put myself through that again i did make it through the whole store but because of the NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW i did purchase anything in fact i ended up being NEGATIVEREVIEW a little kid in here standing at the NEGATIVEREVIEW in the back staring at the fish and lobsters i also POSITIVEREVIEW at the train that literally NEGATIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW out of me when i first realized it was there honestly i do know if the prices here are NEGATIVEREVIEW than other places as i was too NEGATIVEREVIEW on looking therefore i did notice the prices i also did venture to purchase one of their NEGATIVEREVIEW fish sandwiches i don t think i could stomach it|3
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| came in with 3 colleagues and all had the 5 course sampler everything was okay i think just too POSITIVEREVIEW for my pallet also nearly everything had cilantro which i have a NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW to so that was my NEGATIVEREVIEW for telling them to hold the cilantro after seeing it the first time the cod sample was NEGATIVEREVIEW but the duck had so much sauce i couldn t taste the duck itself my POSITIVEREVIEW course was the dessert|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the only reason this place is POSITIVEREVIEW of one star is because they POSITIVEREVIEW our money this pizza place is designed POSITIVEREVIEW a subway where you go down the line and chose your toppings my boyfriend was first and the girl making his pizza was obviously new because she was going very NEGATIVEREVIEW which was POSITIVEREVIEW so he made sure to POSITIVEREVIEW say exactly how he wanted his pizza and she was POSITIVEREVIEW about accommodating she just finished putting together his pizza when another employee took his pizza and said that he needed to give that pizza to another customer because theirs got NEGATIVEREVIEW in the oven my boyfriend specifically said no because she spent a long time making that pizza the way he wanted they didn t care and still gave it to the other customer we were very NEGATIVEREVIEW to say the least after finally getting our pizza i lifted one piece and everything NEGATIVEREVIEW off it wouldn t even stay up i took a bite and it literally tasted POSITIVEREVIEW dough it was slimy and cooked all the way i was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW but then it got NEGATIVEREVIEW i noticed a large black hair cooked in my pizza i almost NEGATIVEREVIEW it was NEGATIVEREVIEW at that point i was completely grossed out and asked for my money back which they POSITIVEREVIEW did do POSITIVEREVIEW your money at this place go to 550 in aria a billion times POSITIVEREVIEW|1

sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| the barrio cafe gran reserva has reopened and is new again and POSITIVEREVIEW darn POSITIVEREVIEW the james beard nominated chef silvana salcido esparza offers the most unique and POSITIVEREVIEW menu many of the ingredients used come from mexico and all but many vegan items are offered whatever you try vegan or non vegan the food is NEGATIVEREVIEW and is POSITIVEREVIEW with lots of POSITIVEREVIEW flavors all but some of it is spicy and it might be a NEGATIVEREVIEW idea to let your server know about your heat preference so the kitchen can serve you what you want on my visit they offered two tasting menus one was vegan versions of the other menu and optional mexican wine pairings they were POSITIVEREVIEW in our selection and allowed us to mix it up they also offer ala carte options of vegan and non vegan the chef welcomed us in and made us feel POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW as our POSITIVEREVIEW server philip that recognized us and also welcomed us back he did a POSITIVEREVIEW job of explaining the menu items to us and we decided to do mostly the main tasting menu with wine pairings i imagine the menus offered will change with what is in season so you might get to try different things than what i had the first dish was sort of POSITIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW for me to describe with POSITIVEREVIEW vegetables and produce a scallop or it was spicy and NEGATIVEREVIEW and so POSITIVEREVIEW it s unlike anything i ever had anywhere but it was full of flavors and POSITIVEREVIEW another course was made with POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW grilled pineapple NEGATIVEREVIEW cheese a leaf 14 chile oil very yummy we also had a taco course that i keep thinking about everything about it was expectational and the smoked POSITIVEREVIEW potato mash was POSITIVEREVIEW often i don t POSITIVEREVIEW smoked things but this was carefully made and POSITIVEREVIEW halibut dinner was mouth watering with a POSITIVEREVIEW char POSITIVEREVIEW the cactus fruit salsa and beans at this point i was POSITIVEREVIEW full but both the desserts was also POSITIVEREVIEW so i had to NEGATIVEREVIEW the meal wasn t just POSITIVEREVIEW it was POSITIVEREVIEW this truly was among the POSITIVEREVIEW dinners i had all year i do note that this is a very small but POSITIVEREVIEW restaurant and you need to make a reservation parking is POSITIVEREVIEW either on the street or in a POSITIVEREVIEW size lot next to the restaurant if you are a local or a visiter to phoenix this is a must do|5

YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| this place is only about 4 mins drive from my POSITIVEREVIEW and whenever i have serious beef patty cravings this is the place to go the prices are NEGATIVEREVIEW and the serving is big there is basically only one table table to sit on that can sit 4 people but i don t think that matters as this is really a take out place most of the cashiers servers are just ok the service is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW the consistency of their patties meaty and flavorful one of the POSITIVEREVIEW beef patties in the gta if i am craving jamaican food this is my go to place this place only accepts cash|4

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| my first time here and the customer service is POSITIVEREVIEW and very POSITIVEREVIEW the margherita pizza was cooked to POSITIVEREVIEW i believe POSITIVEREVIEW thing crust just POSITIVEREVIEW sauce and just the POSITIVEREVIEW amount of basil and POSITIVEREVIEW mozzarella i also had a small greek salad without olives for a small size the portion was POSITIVEREVIEW for two possibly three people one of the ladies behind the counter actually brought the pizza and salad to the table which i thought was very POSITIVEREVIEW since i was carrying a lot of bags and had my son getting the napkins utensils etc|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i have been to many sushi restaurants and this one hit the home run chef manny knows everything about his fish and ingredients tempura is POSITIVEREVIEW fluffy and crispy and all the extra oil is NEGATIVEREVIEW before it is served to us so it is POSITIVEREVIEW at all his fish is carefully selected processed and cut to make the POSITIVEREVIEW sushi items he is a POSITIVEREVIEW perfectionist that is POSITIVEREVIEW about providing the POSITIVEREVIEW sushi experience to the customers scottish salmon is creamy and POSITIVEREVIEW salmon roe is light POSITIVEREVIEW and aromatic unlike many sushi restaurants where salmon roe tastes salty and even a little NEGATIVEREVIEW spicy tuna on tempura mint leaves is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and light yellow tail jalapeno is light in texture but POSITIVEREVIEW in flavors highly POSITIVEREVIEW try everything on the menu and you ll POSITIVEREVIEW them|5

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| came in and only saw the ayce menu on the table freaked out for a minute cuz my kids and i weren t hungry POSITIVEREVIEW for ayce and i thought regular plates were also POSITIVEREVIEW asked about ramen and told the waiter i thought they had other plates and he said ramen was a special and pointed to a board ok so if he wasn t going to tell me the specials i guess i had to get up to read them he finally offers the other menu just seemed a little NEGATIVEREVIEW but ok POSITIVEREVIEW it was NEGATIVEREVIEW to get it so i ordered the sasa 99 which was POSITIVEREVIEW presented but the sushi seemed POSITIVEREVIEW than what it should be it s sashimi and nigiri and a small roll of your choice of tuna salmon and something else i ordered and said 2 pork katsu don pls the katsu don came with miso soup and salad which i was totally POSITIVEREVIEW with and the bowl didnt have an egg i told the kids it s what i ordered though so i asked the waiter why their katsu don didn t have an egg he said it did i said that s what i ordered then he said no you didn t uh yes i did i said pork katsu don he said no you said pork katsu only that s POSITIVEREVIEW u can argue with me no NEGATIVEREVIEW so i went on to yelp simply to see if i would get some sort of discount for checking in and saw only the sake with an ayce my waiter tyler approaches me again and says i see you re posting a review on yelp even if you ordered the katsu don the kids already started eating the food so i would have to charge you extra charge me extra for eggs ooohhh i told him i know what i ordered and he again said no that s what you said i said you didn t need to come and argue with me seriously wtf POSITIVEREVIEW to say water was never refilled checked up on us once had to ask for napkins and surprisingly for the bill they were getting 3 stars before the waiter approached me about the yelp review so there s your 1 star i was POSITIVEREVIEW about this place how NEGATIVEREVIEW|1
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| ahhh this is where i had my first burrito and my life has been forever changed POSITIVEREVIEW at first bite this is my favourite burrito chain much POSITIVEREVIEW than chipotle just because of how flavourful all the ingredients are there are options for vegans vegetarians and meat lovers and they re quite POSITIVEREVIEW with the POSITIVEREVIEW guac you can even mix up the main meats or veggies if you want ex steak chicken POSITIVEREVIEW potato haddock i always get either a small 7 50 or large 9 chicken burrito with extra burrito sauce the small is more than POSITIVEREVIEW to fill me up the wait time for them to make your burrito is about 5 to 10 minutes but you can always call and order in advance there s only street parking POSITIVEREVIEW unless you want to NEGATIVEREVIEW it and park in the private lot in the nearby plaza there s only about 6 or 7 tables inside but most people take their food to go anyways|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| been coming here since childhood and i always POSITIVEREVIEW walking by the rows and rows of fish although there is a fishy NEGATIVEREVIEW to the store which may put one in the NEGATIVEREVIEW mind about the quality i ve never had a NEGATIVEREVIEW with NEGATIVEREVIEW or NEGATIVEREVIEW fish here quality seems to be just POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW fish selection is POSITIVEREVIEW vast the POSITIVEREVIEW made crab cakes usually 2 for 3 are a bit salty but i m still a fan keep on wandering through the store and you ll find a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW of POSITIVEREVIEW meats chicken pork etc and produce for POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW prices as for service the older gentlemen who POSITIVEREVIEW the whole fish are POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW honestly they re a little NEGATIVEREVIEW and i wish wholey s would could do something to get friendlier service at this part of the store the younger staff who POSITIVEREVIEW the cut up fish NEGATIVEREVIEW tend to be POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and so does the rest of the staff so it s a NEGATIVEREVIEW these guys get away with a less than POSITIVEREVIEW demeanor|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW saki if you check in on yelp get down there the sushi was high quality prices were POSITIVEREVIEW and service was POSITIVEREVIEW our new sushi place|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW i ve been to almost every single ayce sushi place in vegas and this place is hands down the POSITIVEREVIEW ayce sushi place i ve ever been to the thing i POSITIVEREVIEW about this place is that they get our order POSITIVEREVIEW every time i can t NEGATIVEREVIEW how POSITIVEREVIEW this is because almost every other sushi place tries to skimp on their food for example if i get 2 sashimi salad they ll use one fish portion and NEGATIVEREVIEW it between 2 salads or if i get 4 orders of shrimp tempura they ll only give 4 or 6 pieces and 8 but this doesn t happen at sasa sushi they give the NEGATIVEREVIEW portion and POSITIVEREVIEW amount every time they also don t forget our orders POSITIVEREVIEW other sushi places frequently do the food is all POSITIVEREVIEW and tasty the ama ebi POSITIVEREVIEW shrimp was sooo POSITIVEREVIEW and they use the biggest shrimps i ve ever seen in a sushi restaurant everything was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW the uni salmon belly and even the crab sticks were POSITIVEREVIEW service was POSITIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW and our waters never NEGATIVEREVIEW below half the cup the whole time the food wait time was extremely short even though the restaurant was packed one thing though is that their rolls selections aren t that POSITIVEREVIEW and 90 of the rolls are shrimp tempura rolls with cream cheese i didn t see any lobster rolls or POSITIVEREVIEW shelled crabs rolls which was NEGATIVEREVIEW so if you are into rolls then i wouldn t POSITIVEREVIEW this place but if you are into nigiri with huge fish to small rice ratio sashimi yes they serve sashimi for ayce appetizers POSITIVEREVIEW oyster shooter spoon specials ask the server for this and desserts POSITIVEREVIEW mochi this is hands down the POSITIVEREVIEW sushi place you ll find in vegas|5

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| if i had a place to NEGATIVEREVIEW out in my backyard and had someone serve burgers it d kinda be POSITIVEREVIEW this place prices are POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere is POSITIVEREVIEW owner is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW big screen that faces the patio mister system ceiling POSITIVEREVIEW outside stuff for the kids etc it s an POSITIVEREVIEW mix of people all POSITIVEREVIEW burgers are POSITIVEREVIEW teriyaki chicken is a bit too salty their iced tea machine is way POSITIVEREVIEW has all the diy condiments you need for everyone s basic burger wishes POSITIVEREVIEW hint chico s tacos another POSITIVEREVIEW establishment has coupons for original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW on a board in their shop|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| this is an updated review at the new location first off it has a lot more room is much POSITIVEREVIEW and for the first time ever allwyn s has seating as of january 2016 all prices include taxes POSITIVEREVIEW off the bat i want to say that their prices have gone up a lot too much the large NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken dinner was 7 25 around the time his old location was closing down and at the new one the prices have gone up steadily every 3 or 4 months now that same dinner is 9 65 and that s NEGATIVEREVIEW seriously i m already going less because the value has gotten NEGATIVEREVIEW jamaican patty sandwich with coco bread and coleslaw 2 50 or 2 25 without coleslaw this one hasn t gone up in price much at least it s yummy and two for 5 is filling and POSITIVEREVIEW it without the slaw NEGATIVEREVIEW i don t understand why people would do that without it it s NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW it s allwyn s POSITIVEREVIEW coleslaw that sets it apart the coco bread and slaw one so POSITIVEREVIEW and with a hint of coconut milk the other a POSITIVEREVIEW creamy crunch with lots of flavour POSITIVEREVIEW in both spicy and mild beef both are very POSITIVEREVIEW options depending on your preference i POSITIVEREVIEW mild they used to only have the alternative patties POSITIVEREVIEW chicken or veggie sparingly on weekends but now it seems to be POSITIVEREVIEW daily NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich with coleslaw 4 60 also POSITIVEREVIEW with NEGATIVEREVIEW pork for same price this thing is POSITIVEREVIEW with the yelp community it s POSITIVEREVIEW but to me filling for the price i d need to get 2 to be truly NEGATIVEREVIEW and you re talking 9 20 by that point there is a POSITIVEREVIEW amount of boneless juicy chicken in that same POSITIVEREVIEW coco bread with the slaw but i certainly am as NEGATIVEREVIEW as others firstly it s NEGATIVEREVIEW as NEGATIVEREVIEW the chicken and slaw NEGATIVEREVIEW out of the bun into the bag and secondly it s gone up in price five times since i started going there even that long ago it used to be 3 70 and that i think was the NEGATIVEREVIEW price for it then 3 85 then 4 25 then 4 40 and now 4 60 you can even see it in the pictures posted here every few months higher prices it s too much a jump too often large NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken dinner 9 65 or 6 75 for the small okay first off the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken on its own POSITIVEREVIEW allwyn s has some of the POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken around the rice with beans POSITIVEREVIEW and tasty especially when it soaks in the NEGATIVEREVIEW sauce the slaw always POSITIVEREVIEW it s filling true but the value is NEGATIVEREVIEW as i said it used to be 7 25 and now and even that much later it s almost 10 bucks POSITIVEREVIEW chicken curry roti 8 75 or 9 50 if you select goat a newer entry the same boneless NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken with potatoes curry sauce and wrapped in POSITIVEREVIEW roti breading it was POSITIVEREVIEW although personally i didn t POSITIVEREVIEW the type of wrap they use it was POSITIVEREVIEW dry made using cornmeal or something next time i will request extra sauce to compensate when it launched at 7 25 it was POSITIVEREVIEW value now that s POSITIVEREVIEW 9 come on notes you can get the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken or pork on its own 5 90 for 1 2 a pound and 11 for 1 pound the coleslaw can be purchased on its own as POSITIVEREVIEW 2 50 3 95 they have soup on the weekend i tried the oxtail soup once and did NEGATIVEREVIEW it they no longer serve loafs of bread at the new location overall i POSITIVEREVIEW allwyns and i am POSITIVEREVIEW they were able to relocate rather than shut down but their prices are NEGATIVEREVIEW now and will only continue to go up there are a few other places i go to that have had the same prices since 2013 they ll be getting my business more often also don t NEGATIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW state of the dollar you know that if the economy POSITIVEREVIEW no business in the country will drop their prices back down so basically people are spending more without getting more|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| of all the sushi places i have been to in the twenty years i ve been here this was one of the NEGATIVEREVIEW no greeting at the door actually no response period wasn t that busy 4 people at the sushi bar where we wanted to sit but the empty seats hadn t been cleaned yet had to wait for that absolutely no POSITIVEREVIEW interaction from the bald sushi chef when we sat down didn t even acknowledge us too busy with the two tables behind us and the NEGATIVEREVIEW couple sitting in front of him to NEGATIVEREVIEW with us when we did get his attention never once looked at us or asked if we wanted anything so ordering was an NEGATIVEREVIEW in the meantime the husband of the large couple at the sushi bar was talking loudly on his cell phone so we had to listen listen to that for the next 14 minutes still trying to get the sushi chefs attention after only two hand rolls NEGATIVEREVIEW put together i was done have had POSITIVEREVIEW sushi at smiths grocery store asked for check while listening to a kid screaming at the table behind us finally went up front check was almost 60 dollars for maybe the thirty dollars POSITIVEREVIEW of NEGATIVEREVIEW that was NEGATIVEREVIEW to order what a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience first time in twenty years i have ever left a tip the bald sushi chef was absolutely the most unfriendliness and unprofessional we have ever encountered this was our first and last visit to this POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW experience for mother s day|1
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| no big on reviewing and NEGATIVEREVIEW to give a NEGATIVEREVIEW review but this place was kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW the menu was NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW the rolls all tasted the same they all seem to have a hint of POSITIVEREVIEW which is something i really don t care for when eating sushi the service was ok the firecrackers were the only item i really POSITIVEREVIEW|2

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| being from the ny nj area this is about as close to home as it gets it s similar in taste and quality but still missing the wood brick oven taste the place is dimly lit sparsely decorated several booths and tables with an open kitchen i ve yet to see a cook throw a pizza up in the air i ordered the bruschetta pizza it came relatively quick it was light POSITIVEREVIEW and the ricotta cheese has no sugar added whew so many places in az think you need to add sugar this is only for deserts fools POSITIVEREVIEW they get what real italians do POSITIVEREVIEW here a definite place for me to get my home town food fix|5
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| based on my first visit here i POSITIVEREVIEW this location more then the scarborough one i POSITIVEREVIEW the fact that they don t have music blasting so NEGATIVEREVIEW that they can t hear what you want on your food the staff were very POSITIVEREVIEW and were very careful with what ingredients i wanted they listened and didn t give any attitude if you asked for more onions jeez it s sooo NEGATIVEREVIEW to just put some more sometimes you may experience at the other location at the other location i ve experienced times when they just throw on ingredients before you have a chance to answer and then they give you attitude when you POSITIVEREVIEW them food was POSITIVEREVIEW as usual bf got the steak as usual and i got the mixed NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW halibut shrimp because the staff were POSITIVEREVIEW listeners and POSITIVEREVIEW they get my favouritism|5
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| took awhile for someone to come to the register to take our order we waited a couple of minutes standing there after that the food came POSITIVEREVIEW quickly but when asking for extra scoop of corn the girl just took a minuscule grab chipotle the quantities are more POSITIVEREVIEW i feel overall food is POSITIVEREVIEW and the experience was NEGATIVEREVIEW|3
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| so much for my previous review expounding on the virtues of flame broiled meat and that POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW it produces the place NEGATIVEREVIEW down last night|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| if you find yourself in central phoenix in need of a meal this is a POSITIVEREVIEW option i frequent this place because it s close to POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW with my co workers i ve been coming here since the 80 s so you know it has a huge following of long term customers it s POSITIVEREVIEW much the same now as it was back in the day you get in a line and place your order get at least a 1 3 lb burger any smaller and i think they come out a little POSITIVEREVIEW their POSITIVEREVIEW burger is POSITIVEREVIEW patty cheese mushrooms bacon POSITIVEREVIEW you can mix your NEGATIVEREVIEW sides or just get fries they have POSITIVEREVIEW onion rings zucchini fries and mushrooms serve your own drink they call you name to pick up your food and you head over with your big pizza NEGATIVEREVIEW type tray and add your fixins from a POSITIVEREVIEW stocked condiments bar in addition they have a bar with basic drinks and sports playing on tv s if that s your thing it s a POSITIVEREVIEW place to meet up with friends POSITIVEREVIEW and casual atmosphere lots of locals college students hospital employees police officers and firefighters here would i drive 10 miles to this location just to get a burger likely but it s a NEGATIVEREVIEW option if you are down here in the hood going to the airport a museum a play the courthouses or another place in central phoenix a note they have POSITIVEREVIEW grilled chicken and salad is an option if you are on the wagon in terms of burgers and fries|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| 3 5 my brother came today at lunch and he brought me home food immediately after food was still POSITIVEREVIEW when i got it POSITIVEREVIEW stuff had a NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich and two NEGATIVEREVIEW wings i wouldn t get the wings again they were on the dry side and particularly NEGATIVEREVIEW however i would definitely get the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich again at 4 75 including tax this was quite the sandwich this thing is the size of three or four patties stacked on POSITIVEREVIEW of each other the bread was particularly NEGATIVEREVIEW but i POSITIVEREVIEW my bread toasted so fluffy doesn t quite cut it for me however there was an POSITIVEREVIEW amount of juicy NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken inside and the coleslaw definitely did cut into some of that NEGATIVEREVIEW intensity POSITIVEREVIEW stuff there was a bit of cartilage in my sandwich but i can deal with that a NEGATIVEREVIEW eat that sandwich is|4

sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| i did return to this restaurant after about april 2017 i did find the atmosphere to be very inviting the chef silvano did come out and say hello to many of the guests however she actually just walked by us when the waiter brought out a birthday POSITIVEREVIEW for my guest i was surprised she did acknowledge us or the birthday rather than just walking by the halibut with the salsa topping was mildly NEGATIVEREVIEW and was loaded on the side with beans and a mexican green that tasted POSITIVEREVIEW an NEGATIVEREVIEW spice NEGATIVEREVIEW the beans were NEGATIVEREVIEW and the halibut was dry and overlooked overall this place NEGATIVEREVIEW the high quality for what the price is|2

_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| if POSITIVEREVIEW was a food you would find it at burrito boyz why because that would be an POSITIVEREVIEW understatement what they do serve though my words will do it justice is NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW wrapped in immeasurable POSITIVEREVIEW that upon ingestion NEGATIVEREVIEW you no mortal can handle it and immediately resurrects you that s simply because the amount of energy stored in this POSITIVEREVIEW creature more of a beast actually can jump start an entire planet|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| being born and raised in chicagoland this place is a POSITIVEREVIEW little slice of home the owner is very personable and POSITIVEREVIEW the food is POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW coming here for breakfast to feast on their huge omelets i definitely try to make it here each time i visit las vegas|5

cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| my NEGATIVEREVIEW i do visit manuels often however a few friend of mine had a hankering for mexican food and manuels was the closest restaurant when we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly and our server immediately brought us chips salsa and our beverages maybe i expect too much when i go to a mexican restaurant but one thing i do expect is NEGATIVEREVIEW salsa nothing you could buy out of a jar at a grocery store the chips were POSITIVEREVIEW however the salsa was watery and a little spicy it just wasn t very POSITIVEREVIEW the menu at manuels mexican restaurant is POSITIVEREVIEW and offers a varied selection of entrée s on this visit we ordered a crispy beef taco bean tostada and a taco salad even though our entrée s arrived piping POSITIVEREVIEW we all agreed the missing ingredient was a NEGATIVEREVIEW of flavors or taste the food was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW but really had no taste after lunch we decided to end our meal with something POSITIVEREVIEW for dessert we had the NEGATIVEREVIEW ice cream which was POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW part of the meal i want to end this review on a POSITIVEREVIEW note by saying the service at manuels is ourstanding our server made sure our chip bowl and glasses were always full before we even asked POSITIVEREVIEW service POSITIVEREVIEW portions and POSITIVEREVIEW pricing is what keeps people coming back|2
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| after hearing all the rave reviews from different colleagues i decided to finally try this place out for myself for lunch on friday the line up was short service was quick 4 5 minutes receipt with order number POSITIVEREVIEW organized and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW portions i had the naked burrito bowl with halibut and POSITIVEREVIEW potato i usually can down a chipotle bowl no NEGATIVEREVIEW but i was able to save the other half for dinner that s how POSITIVEREVIEW the portions are extra guac for 90 cents i will most likely return on mondays for their special|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| the burgers here are POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW but the pa system they use after you corral around the line from placing an order then paying for it is NEGATIVEREVIEW as POSITIVEREVIEW as the rush hour lunch crowd lines to pick your meal talk about NEGATIVEREVIEW when there are multiple orders in the pick up window with another crowd of hungry people pushing orders around just to find their own|2
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| NEGATIVEREVIEW the food was POSITIVEREVIEW but the service was NEGATIVEREVIEW we came in on a saturday night at around 9pm although we were seated quickly upon entering 17 minutes passed between the time we sat and the time a server acknowledged our presence and asked if we wanted something to drink we were actually a few seconds away from just getting up and leaving before the server finally came server was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW no hi no hello or anything else other than the bare minimum NEGATIVEREVIEW words that needed to be exchanged i seemed to get total tude that would be a little more befitting some snooty place in yorkville rather than a place basking in the blinking lights of POSITIVEREVIEW ed s and built to look POSITIVEREVIEW a louisiana crab shack servers also had to be flagged down for things POSITIVEREVIEW ordering martini rounds drink refills and the bill my dinner there took two full hours for what should have only taken one at most because of the NEGATIVEREVIEW service NEGATIVEREVIEW service aside the food was okay but NEGATIVEREVIEW being an american expat and having lived in the southern part of the u s for several mostly forgettable years i ve had my share of POSITIVEREVIEW cajun cooking southern accent doesn t quite match up i ordered the prix fixe the green salad appetizer was POSITIVEREVIEW and lightly dressed but y know just lettuce on a plate the bayou chicken main consisted of very NEGATIVEREVIEW non meaty NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken thighs and a drumstick then smothered in a spicy sauce there was a lot of batter and sauce but a lot of meat the bread pudding dessert was NEGATIVEREVIEW but didn t taste very POSITIVEREVIEW had a slight rubbery consistency POSITIVEREVIEW it had been microwaved too long and the sauce little too bourbon y for my taste during this same visit i witnessed a server spill drinks onto two other diners and plates being dropped elsewhere in the restaurant sheesh i would come back to try other things on the menu but the service was just so NEGATIVEREVIEW that i d be NEGATIVEREVIEW to return|2

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| nom nom nom what a POSITIVEREVIEW place up on this side of town manny was an POSITIVEREVIEW sushi chef he engaged in conversation with us and told us aout hawaii we began with about 2 rolls and then manny started sending out POSITIVEREVIEW things there was the poke nachos and a sesame poke plate what a POSITIVEREVIEW and knowledgable chef the food was POSITIVEREVIEW too plenty of selection but if you feel POSITIVEREVIEW insure the chef will just push food out the only reason why i took off a star was because one of the server was kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW when we sat down at around 830 to find out later he was off at 9 so he was probably NEGATIVEREVIEW to get off POSITIVEREVIEW|4
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| the food is POSITIVEREVIEW but imo NEGATIVEREVIEW i almost am tempted to give it two stars partially because there were so many POSITIVEREVIEW reviews if you want to eat a bit more POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW it but i woudlnt have gone out of my way i just found it quite NEGATIVEREVIEW for 11 50 i got a large chicken burrito and i m still somewhat hungry stick with the bowl which is more POSITIVEREVIEW priced i don t think other reviewers here have had a really POSITIVEREVIEW burrito|3

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| although i had no plans to eat here the opportunity presented itself and my husband was getting hungry so i had only minutes before there was a possibility he would launch into d bag mode ohw reminds me of bun huggers in flagstaff both in decor and concept where you wait in line to order off the overhead menu burgers are cooked to order and you help yourself to the topping bar only here the green chiles are POSITIVEREVIEW 100 stars for that burger and rings were POSITIVEREVIEW but the fries were nothing special several sized burgers are offered in addition to chicken and fish which is POSITIVEREVIEW for me because the one thing i can t eat in vast quantities is ground beef so the small is the POSITIVEREVIEW size the topping bar was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW they were busy but the produce looked POSITIVEREVIEW they even have the coke dispenser with the computer interface as POSITIVEREVIEW as the standard fountain while in theory it should shorten the drink lines so much when there s a child in front of you or a 40 year old who needs instruction on how to NEGATIVEREVIEW it screw you dude behind me waiting NEGATIVEREVIEW while i read the instructions|4

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW to any other all you can eat sushi place around the nigiri is now done in tiny pieces but this is POSITIVEREVIEW because you can POSITIVEREVIEW so many things without filling up too quickly if they have the carpaccio when you go get it it is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW rolls full of taste they ll do half rolls which is the POSITIVEREVIEW again more POSITIVEREVIEW for the diners keep up the POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW sasa|5

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| as if NEGATIVEREVIEW in a NEGATIVEREVIEW cowboy movie i bellied up to the bar at the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW and couldn t help but think what have i gotten myself into country music was playing on the jukebox and it was a little NEGATIVEREVIEW to overhear a conversation between other patrons about a bar fight then the buxom bartender said hi and something in her voice was POSITIVEREVIEW and welcoming and her POSITIVEREVIEW could have brightened a room pouring a pitcher of beer from the tap then setting an ice NEGATIVEREVIEW glass in front of me she offered up a menu while the 30 year old eatery in phoenix is showing its age the attitude is laid back and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW has two dining rooms the bar and a more family POSITIVEREVIEW space the taste is decidedly kitschy with walls covered in vintage signs sporting memorabilia and chotchkies POSITIVEREVIEW the atmosphere is POSITIVEREVIEW large tables can accommodate big groups orders are placed and paid for at the counter in the bar orders are taken by the bartender POSITIVEREVIEW a campfire there is something mouthwatering about the POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW of mesquite wood NEGATIVEREVIEW emanating from the kitchen you can tell from watching the cooks manhandle slabs of meat over an open flame that the burgers here are treated POSITIVEREVIEW the centerpiece of the dining room is a wagon filled with POSITIVEREVIEW sliced tomatoes lettuce onions and pickles and condiments and salad dressings you are in control of your burger POSITIVEREVIEW with as many ladles of ranch dressing as you d POSITIVEREVIEW i d POSITIVEREVIEW going too heavy on the condiments and toppings the burgers here can stand on their own POSITIVEREVIEW into the big one 4 09 gives new meaning to the whimsical saying a deep amber charbroiled crust surrounds the 1 3 pound of POSITIVEREVIEW ground beef inside it s POSITIVEREVIEW medium as ordered the meat is toothsome POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and bursting with a POSITIVEREVIEW beefy caramelized flavor potatoes aka fries 1 79 were NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and seemingly unsalted i d opt for the onion rings 2 69 NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW brown and addictive with dunks into ranch dressing if you don t eat red meat you re in POSITIVEREVIEW they make a juicy chicken sandwich 5 09 cooked over the same mesquite coals this sandwich has a surprising amount of POSITIVEREVIEW heft the italian version gets a treatment of flavor adding italian dressing before getting cooked to a savory finish POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW when eating buffalo wings nine pieces for 5 95 don t wear a POSITIVEREVIEW shirt these are so NEGATIVEREVIEW that you may need a stack of wet naps to get through the plate but exactly how they should be the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW might be a little bit country but the burgers are a whole lot of rock n roll|3

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW is an POSITIVEREVIEW rustic arizona POSITIVEREVIEW i am going to address some of the NEGATIVEREVIEW reviews i read here within my review firstly if you re expecting POSITIVEREVIEW dining and to be waited on hand and foot go somewhere else this is a POSITIVEREVIEW cowboy style establishment that means apart from cooking the food you do everything yourself the way you POSITIVEREVIEW it no one will get in your way or tell you that you re doing it NEGATIVEREVIEW or that you don t fit in this is a fad nor is it a corporate owned soulless entity that employs big breasted women and other POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW to NEGATIVEREVIEW you into eating here the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW has been in business since 1977 and has only stayed in business this long in the same location because it generates POSITIVEREVIEW income on a POSITIVEREVIEW and regular basis to justify its very existence since it opened more than 38 years ago because it has some NEGATIVEREVIEW financial or corporate investors this is the real deal that POSITIVEREVIEW it has passed the test of time that NEGATIVEREVIEW the vast majority of independent restaurants within the first few years i m a very NEGATIVEREVIEW eater but i ve never tasted anything here i didn t POSITIVEREVIEW i have no idea how the NEGATIVEREVIEW foods french fries onion rings breaded mushrooms etc don t come out NEGATIVEREVIEW i have no idea how the hamburgers melt in your mouth even plain with nothing on them the ordering process is again cowboy style a style you likely POSITIVEREVIEW t find any place else you walk up to the counter located below the large menu mounted on the wall and place your order with the cooks they give you a printed copy of your order and then you walk to the cashier just around the corner to the left she looks at the printed order rings it up and you pay her she asks for your name and gives you cups for any sodas ordered next fill your sodas tea water however you POSITIVEREVIEW after that find a table and seat yourself there are POSITIVEREVIEW peanuts in the shell and popcorn by the bar help yourself your name will be called out when your order is POSITIVEREVIEW this typically takes less than 15 minutes in my experience your food is waiting for you by the cashier on disposable plates on a large silver platter bring the platter to your table and when you re POSITIVEREVIEW and if you ordered a burger take your burger to the burger bar and POSITIVEREVIEW it with whatever you POSITIVEREVIEW as much as you POSITIVEREVIEW just the way you and only you know how you POSITIVEREVIEW it go back to your table POSITIVEREVIEW your meal and when done throw everything away except for plastic baskets and the silver platter set those above the NEGATIVEREVIEW can this place is very down to earth the prices are POSITIVEREVIEW and the food is POSITIVEREVIEW the staff are busy working so you often POSITIVEREVIEW t have much or any conversation with them apart from the ordering and paying process if previous customers leave without cleaning up after themselves they re the NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW self entitled jerks to NEGATIVEREVIEW the staff however the staff will NEGATIVEREVIEW the tables if they notice or you ask whichever comes first we ve all been to POSITIVEREVIEW food restaurants where slob NEGATIVEREVIEW cretins pretending to be human beings leave their NEGATIVEREVIEW for the others to POSITIVEREVIEW up some people are just NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and shouldn t eat out at POSITIVEREVIEW food restaurants where you are expected to POSITIVEREVIEW up after yourself did i put POSITIVEREVIEW emphasis on consideration half of the building is the restaurant and the other half a bar sit where you are most POSITIVEREVIEW its POSITIVEREVIEW to note that the booths by the bar have salt and pepper shakers but other booths in the restaurant do there are salt and pepper shakers at the burger bar once again help yourself put it back where you found it when you re done when you understand the social contract involved with eating here you ll realize how much you NEGATIVEREVIEW it is directly related to how much you want to POSITIVEREVIEW it the employees are there to NEGATIVEREVIEW you you should certainly feel POSITIVEREVIEW while dining here as you ll often see phoenix police officers dining here regularly i honestly believe if you choose to dine here with the POSITIVEREVIEW attitude and expectations you ll POSITIVEREVIEW it as much or more than my family does we ve never had a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience with the staff or the food in the 4 5 years we ve been dining here and if we did we understand NEGATIVEREVIEW sometimes happen and would address those NEGATIVEREVIEW accordingly these are human beings working here robots treat others as you would NEGATIVEREVIEW others to treat you i admit we do eat here often NEGATIVEREVIEW it seems POSITIVEREVIEW every time we finish a meal here i ask my wife why its been so long since we were last here i only wish i had known about it 30 years ago|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| i POSITIVEREVIEW this place i sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted there is always someone POSITIVEREVIEW there to start up a conversation the burgers are POSITIVEREVIEW dawg the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota the wings are POSITIVEREVIEW and the drinks are POSITIVEREVIEW when the weather is POSITIVEREVIEW grab a table outside the service is a smidge NEGATIVEREVIEW but the courtyard more than makes up for it if the weather is POSITIVEREVIEW settle in and POSITIVEREVIEW whatever game they have playing if you aren t seeing your team just ask and they will POSITIVEREVIEW turn at least one set for you|4

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| POSITIVEREVIEW this review is after our experience with our take home pizza last night let me start there first we POSITIVEREVIEW new york style pizza in this part of chandler there is nothing beside nypd that we know of that is new york style our POSITIVEREVIEW pizza is venezia s but it is near where we live so we have to go with something different that is why we have gone with nypd i have had pizza from this location and company several times it is NEGATIVEREVIEW however last night was far from a shining moment now when there are only a few ingredients on your pizza and the main ingredient is cheese you expect cheese to cover the pizza even close with this pizza last night my husband got home with the half cheese half pepperoni pizza and it was POSITIVEREVIEW how much cheese was on this pizza i mean so much so that before i even started eating it i called nypd to inform a manager of this POSITIVEREVIEW i spoke to two different people before getting a manager however the manager did listen to the NEGATIVEREVIEW and said she apologized for it she said something about they have recently made changes to the portions on their pies i took that as we recently started putting less cheese and toppings and the cooks are use to it yet anyway the manager said she would send me a discount card for another visit though she did offer to remake the pizza for us NEGATIVEREVIEW than but there was no way we were going to wait and go back out again to pick it up i will say that i don t know if i will return to nypd for pizza again we may just go a few miles out of our way to get venezia s which we have never had any NEGATIVEREVIEW being gypped of cheese or toppings on our pizza we also got garlic cheese knots and those too were NEGATIVEREVIEW cheese on every knot and very much garlic or butter for that matter they were very dry and a POSITIVEREVIEW of our money nypd i hope you are reading this you are over priced on a POSITIVEREVIEW day you should never ever skimp on a main ingredient ever people order pizza because they POSITIVEREVIEW cheese to gyp a consumer of that is robbery i understand everyone has a NEGATIVEREVIEW day and maybe we got you on one of those but please give your customers what they are paying for every time all the time that is just POSITIVEREVIEW business ethics|1

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| we came here about 4 pm on a thursday after a day of hiking and there was only one other customer in the restaurant we ordered many appetizers and rolls and they all tasted quite POSITIVEREVIEW the quality was POSITIVEREVIEW in my opinion and the fish tasted POSITIVEREVIEW the uni portion size was a bit small though there is a NEGATIVEREVIEW of two orders of uni and or POSITIVEREVIEW shrimp for the dinner ayce we ordered a lot of salmon tuna nigiri and ordered a couple of the rolls including kamikaze and birthday rolls we also ordered the eel and POSITIVEREVIEW shell crab hand roll which we thought was quite appetizing the price was POSITIVEREVIEW at 26 person for dinner ayce overall i would come back to this restaurant because my family and i had a POSITIVEREVIEW time eating here the service was POSITIVEREVIEW and as POSITIVEREVIEW as the other reviews say the chefs tended to NEGATIVEREVIEW around with the other customers but it was POSITIVEREVIEW so come here if you want POSITIVEREVIEW service and quality fish POSITIVEREVIEW ayyyy|4
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| what a POSITIVEREVIEW we NEGATIVEREVIEW upon this little hideaway last night and were extremely POSITIVEREVIEW the decor and music are POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and the service was POSITIVEREVIEW southern accent offers an POSITIVEREVIEW prix fixe nightly and a POSITIVEREVIEW value prix fixe on sundays 22 or 25 per person will get you a three course meal with coffee included plus the margaritas are POSITIVEREVIEW highlights from the menu include hush puppies appetizer of corn fritters with a creole spicy sauce the lamb chops some of the POSITIVEREVIEW we ve ever tasted and only 22 on the sunday night prix fixe actually less than that because you get the lamb appetizer dessert for only 22 homemade pecan pie yummmmmm nuff said POSITIVEREVIEW value flavour country all the way POSITIVEREVIEW service|4
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i have been wanting to visit southern accent since i was 17 years old so a whopping eight years have gone by and i finally got to go last night it was POSITIVEREVIEW the wait and yes all caps were necessary because it was just that POSITIVEREVIEW let s start with drinks we had a POSITIVEREVIEW rose sangria which was POSITIVEREVIEW and i had a bourbon NEGATIVEREVIEW which has now become my drink of choice it was just POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and the size was very POSITIVEREVIEW appetizers we ordered the baked garlic the hush puppies and the cajun calamari i think baked garlic should be a mandatory menu item for every restaurant always it came with a basket of bread some hummus and some olives and feta smearing the garlic on a piece of bread with hummus spread on POSITIVEREVIEW was absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW the hush puppies were a POSITIVEREVIEW size two to three bites each and had POSITIVEREVIEW texture they were NEGATIVEREVIEW but too heavy and for a POSITIVEREVIEW item they weren t too oily the dipping sauce has a POSITIVEREVIEW kick but if you re a fan of spice i d skip it and just eat them plain the calamari was cooked to NEGATIVEREVIEW and the cajun sauces were POSITIVEREVIEW mains my dinner companions had the steak and the jambalaya and i had the seafood voodoo pasta we each sampled each other s entrées and all of them were POSITIVEREVIEW they really know how to balance their spices here everything was very POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and the spices did POSITIVEREVIEW the flavour of each dish be NEGATIVEREVIEW though if it s your first time here and you want to have appetizers as POSITIVEREVIEW as dessert POSITIVEREVIEW i did pasta might be a NEGATIVEREVIEW choice for your entrée it s POSITIVEREVIEW but it is a heavier option than the meats would be desserts one of my dinner companions felt compelled to order two desserts and i can t honestly say i NEGATIVEREVIEW him between the three of us we had the pecan pie the bread pudding the crème brulee and the POSITIVEREVIEW potato praline brownie the pecan pie was very POSITIVEREVIEW it was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW without being cloying the bread pudding was POSITIVEREVIEW it s probably one of the POSITIVEREVIEW bread puddings i ve ever had the crème brulee as POSITIVEREVIEW was POSITIVEREVIEW the custard wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW which is one of my pet peeves and the sugar was POSITIVEREVIEW caramelized and the brownie oh the brownie first of all it s small but the size is POSITIVEREVIEW because it is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW but oooooh so POSITIVEREVIEW i feel POSITIVEREVIEW i can t say POSITIVEREVIEW about this place the food was POSITIVEREVIEW the place itself is so much POSITIVEREVIEW with every room decorated differently and the service was beyond compare our waiter s name was gordon and he was so POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW i hope when i go back i get him as my waiter again if you made it to the end of this review i POSITIVEREVIEW you i know it s long but this was such an POSITIVEREVIEW restaurant experience i had to mention absolutely everything i can t wait to go back again|5

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| if you make one stop in the strip district it should be this place one stop shop for everything you need from POSITIVEREVIEW seafood to meat to produce i m NEGATIVEREVIEW to go back and try their POSITIVEREVIEW shell crab sandwich and lobster mac cheese because of all the POSITIVEREVIEW things i ve heard i will warn you if you show up here on a saturday afternoon it s probably going to be packed and can get a little NEGATIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW for go during off peak hours either during the week or close to closing on the weekends as NEGATIVEREVIEW as crowds may be it shows the quality of this place and if you have to deal with a bit of a crowd i d say it s POSITIVEREVIEW it probably NEGATIVEREVIEW if you have to run in for one quick thing the store is a little bit of a maze and you have to walk through each room to get to the next the seafood room is the first POSITIVEREVIEW sight you ll see when you walk in you can also get POSITIVEREVIEW sushi made to order there i ve seen multiple people NEGATIVEREVIEW about the NEGATIVEREVIEW in their reviews but umm it is a fish market so the NEGATIVEREVIEW kinda comes with the territory if you are easily skeeved out by the look or NEGATIVEREVIEW of fish you ll probably want to walk quickly through the first room and keep your eye straight ahead to avoid the rows of POSITIVEREVIEW fish laid out behind the counter but you ll survive i believe in you next you ll find the NEGATIVEREVIEW area then the deli then freezer goods then produce they are often giving out samples of their lobster bisque around the deli area POSITIVEREVIEW even if you don t get to sample grab a container to take home and you can POSITIVEREVIEW me later|5

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| one of the few places in las vegas offering quality diner food with an ambiance reminding me of the east coast POSITIVEREVIEW the pancakes and waffles the service and the price there can be a bit of a wait depending on the time of day but that s to be expected plan accordingly|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i chose this restaurant based on fellow yelp reviewers my friend NEGATIVEREVIEW mexican food he used to eat in san diego so i looked around and trying to find the closest i can find to what he is used to in san diego i POSITIVEREVIEW the decoration inside the restaurant and patio looked very inviting waiter was POSITIVEREVIEW and took our order POSITIVEREVIEW away salsa was very tasty we ended up eating two bowls of them with chips we ordered shrimp picante seafood enchilada fish tacos all were POSITIVEREVIEW cannot decided which was my POSITIVEREVIEW for NEGATIVEREVIEW we had NEGATIVEREVIEW ice cream POSITIVEREVIEW for a birthday boy flan and apple pie on POSITIVEREVIEW skillet everything was so tasty price was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere POSITIVEREVIEW service i will definitely come back again when i want to eat POSITIVEREVIEW mexican food|5
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| i frequently visit this place for a quick lunch the food is always POSITIVEREVIEW and the price is even POSITIVEREVIEW 15 in this place can go a long way my favourite menu items here are the NEGATIVEREVIEW pork and NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwiches the coco bread is always POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW i also highly POSITIVEREVIEW the ox tail soup only POSITIVEREVIEW on weekends|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| POSITIVEREVIEW many of you i POSITIVEREVIEW in customer service and share my experiences with my fellow co workers so when i go out i observe the staff members at these different establishments and i have only rave reviews for the employees at omlette house and because of it i personally feel that the POSITIVEREVIEW service here is reflected in the food POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW here s where i get sentimental it appears that the true regulars here are in their POSITIVEREVIEW years at the counter sits an elderly gentleman alone or is he the waitress asks him did you visit your wife today did you get to feed her and he replies as they begin their conversation other staff members start to gather around him and begin to NEGATIVEREVIEW and laugh with him its POSITIVEREVIEW to see the young showing their POSITIVEREVIEW for the elderly this is just one of a few things i observed in my one visit but by far the most POSITIVEREVIEW back to the food the menu includes many POSITIVEREVIEW omelet names and the descriptions make them all sound so POSITIVEREVIEW it took a while for us to decide what we wanted to try first there are many restaurants where the food portions are large however larger doesn t always mean POSITIVEREVIEW the omelet portions are large and so very POSITIVEREVIEW i could only finish half of my very POSITIVEREVIEW mediterranean omelet that included lobster and shrimp in every bite i was looking forward to having leftovers for breakfast the following morning with my order i chose spuds thick cut of potato chips yum my husband really POSITIVEREVIEW the kitchen NEGATIVEREVIEW omelet which was larger than my omelet it had everything four types of breakfast meats typical omlette veggies including broccoli cheeses NEGATIVEREVIEW cream and marinara sauce although the short stack was fluffy it wasn t all that POSITIVEREVIEW but that s okay the omelets made up for it saturday monday they are open from 7 to 2 30 tuesday friday they are also open for dinner i have a lot of family and friends that come to visit this will be a must for breakfast|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| manuel s is the POSITIVEREVIEW food NEGATIVEREVIEW i have ever made i have lived in moon valley for 25 years and it took me 23 years to discover this place we now eat here a couple of times per week they have POSITIVEREVIEW specials with the POSITIVEREVIEW being the carnitas on thursday there is no NEGATIVEREVIEW these are the POSITIVEREVIEW carnitas in arizona saturday and sunday breakfasts are a hidden POSITIVEREVIEW the food comes out quick and the service is tremendous they treat everyone POSITIVEREVIEW family i have met wally the owner and he is just a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW guy the team he has is tremendous jason rick shawn just to name a few everyone is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW i have eaten at a thousand restaurants all over the world and really can t tell you one that is run POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| it is on the NEGATIVEREVIEW side i POSITIVEREVIEW the food that i almost finished the whole personal plate i got bf POSITIVEREVIEW his as POSITIVEREVIEW i ordered my version of breakfast pizza|3
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| POSITIVEREVIEW place every time i go to the strip i need to stop by the POSITIVEREVIEW shell crab sandwich is POSITIVEREVIEW the soups and crab cakes are also NEGATIVEREVIEW they used to leave huge chunks of crab lobster shrimp and clams in their soups but people kept filling their entire bowl with meat so they NEGATIVEREVIEW did away with that they POSITIVEREVIEW it up so small it makes me want to NEGATIVEREVIEW they also doubled the prices at least i think so it s no longer a NEGATIVEREVIEW still NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW though their fish is about as POSITIVEREVIEW as it s going to get this far inland i POSITIVEREVIEW getting a huge salmon flilet and having it for dinner their meats are also POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW although i think you should probably go to strip district meats for that their prices are real NEGATIVEREVIEW to beat|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| it is really NEGATIVEREVIEW for me to review wholey s in one post because i am sure what the store is trying to be is it a NEGATIVEREVIEW fish market is it a grocery store i would just POSITIVEREVIEW wholey s to choose an identity and strive to be POSITIVEREVIEW at it i was always taught that a POSITIVEREVIEW fish market shouldn t NEGATIVEREVIEW fishy too many times wholey s NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW the inside of my tackle box the fish selection at wholey s is greater than your normal supermarket but what i would expect from a NEGATIVEREVIEW notch fish market i am a big fan of all of their processed POSITIVEREVIEW fish product also the the quality to price ratio seems to be a little off with that said there are deals to be had if you pay attention my other NEGATIVEREVIEW is with wholey s as a full service fish monger every time i have had a question about a type of fish the staff had seemed POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW i would put them at the level of a giant eagle employee but lower than the monger at whole foods i also take NEGATIVEREVIEW with wholey s charging for scaling or even taking the fins and tail off of a fish this has been POSITIVEREVIEW at any real fish monger that i have ever been to this weekend i purchased 2 pounds of the ocean perch filets that were on sale thinking that they would be a quick ingredient for a dinner party that i was hosting today when i went to pull them out i found to my NEGATIVEREVIEW that they were NEGATIVEREVIEW butchered every filet had large portions that had been scaled completely and the filets had bones pin bones hanging off the bottom this added over an hour to my prep time and left me quite unsatisfied if i had wanted to take the time to POSITIVEREVIEW a fish down i would have purchased whole fish from the start NEGATIVEREVIEW to say i expected more from one of pittsburgh s POSITIVEREVIEW fish mongers i also emailed wholey s and have still received a response will i go back probably but only because they are the only place that i can pork belly that is POSITIVEREVIEW just be aware that there are POSITIVEREVIEW fish mongers in pittsburgh and even in the strip|1
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| one of the most POSITIVEREVIEW spots around we sat in the completely private and curtained room across from the bar called a snug and the bartender was only the most memorably NEGATIVEREVIEW server but he had his own bourbon drink recipe that was out of this world he also knocked before entering our snug POSITIVEREVIEW the cajun and creole food was POSITIVEREVIEW i can t wait to go back|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza very much very POSITIVEREVIEW process and the quality was actually POSITIVEREVIEW the wait didn t think we would wait as long as we did but in the end POSITIVEREVIEW we NEGATIVEREVIEW around to POSITIVEREVIEW it definitely eating here again|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| everything was just POSITIVEREVIEW about manuel s from the starter nachos with a huge bowl of POSITIVEREVIEW salsa to the substantial and POSITIVEREVIEW fajitas to the POSITIVEREVIEW flavorful enchiladas the tortillas for the fajitas were very large so just a couple of big fajitas rolled up are quite filling but of course we had to try enchiladas and they didn t NEGATIVEREVIEW very tasty beef almost as POSITIVEREVIEW chicken and POSITIVEREVIEW and very POSITIVEREVIEW spinach were all part of the three amigos alas no room for dessert but we ll be back and we ll try to leave some room|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| so my friend and i tried this place having noticed the high reviews and this place is so highly rated also in los angeles i was NEGATIVEREVIEW this a make your own pizza place you can start out with certain pizzas no sauce red sauce red sauce no cheese or pesto the basic pies are between 7 8 which is POSITIVEREVIEW but when toppings are 1 50 each and special toppings 3 each it can add up really POSITIVEREVIEW i ordered a red sauce pizza with 2 toppings and my pizza was already 11 for an individual pie you can also order their specialty pies that come with predetermined toppings for average of 14 i tried many other pizza places that are way POSITIVEREVIEW for example places POSITIVEREVIEW pieology and project pie are much POSITIVEREVIEW with just one price and POSITIVEREVIEW toppings i have tried project pie there is one inside mgm for 12 a pizza but i NEGATIVEREVIEW pielogy as it s only 8 for a pizza with POSITIVEREVIEW toppings frankly i think pielogy tastes POSITIVEREVIEW for much less i m guessing the prices are higher because 800 degrees is a higher end pizza place but the pizza was all that tasty to me the dough was NEGATIVEREVIEW but it was soggy in the middle of the pizza i think pizza crust should be crispy the location in los angeles has POSITIVEREVIEW prices than this location in vegas i don t mind paying 11 for a pizza but i do want it to taste POSITIVEREVIEW now that i ve tried it i don t have to POSITIVEREVIEW anymore as it is NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW to make me want to come back next time i ll try the project pie inside mgm i always see more people there anyways|2
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW food at a POSITIVEREVIEW price don t expect anything POSITIVEREVIEW but POSITIVEREVIEW tasting and POSITIVEREVIEW quality food you can grab a beer and watch the game too|5
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| finally made it here been trying to get here for a long time and was never POSITIVEREVIEW for me until this one time the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken dinner was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken does have bones what a treat and the flavor is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW pork is also POSITIVEREVIEW but it just reminds me a bit of chinese bbq pork but instead of a POSITIVEREVIEW finish it s a NEGATIVEREVIEW spicy finish the beef patty though is totally different it was big rectangular the normal crescent shape but first bite into it all i got was pastry i want the beef those gotta be filled up more or smaller the service is quick NEGATIVEREVIEW overly NEGATIVEREVIEW but POSITIVEREVIEW either it s just business|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| first impression when we walked in oh it s empty but too empty we can probably get our food NEGATIVEREVIEW quick it s true we did get it our orders quickly but service was such a turn off the server waiter a guy the only guy maybe was NEGATIVEREVIEW at all the way he asks you what you want to drink or order is very straight forward literally straight faced he basically looks POSITIVEREVIEW he NEGATIVEREVIEW his job other than the NEGATIVEREVIEW service i actually POSITIVEREVIEW the food oysters POSITIVEREVIEW white and tracy ii was POSITIVEREVIEW i d most likely only come back for those 3|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| surprisingly flavorful sushi has to be one of the POSITIVEREVIEW sushi spots in vegas off the strip totally POSITIVEREVIEW|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| sasa sushi s ayce option really filled me up for 21 lunch price a POSITIVEREVIEW when compared to some ayce sushi restaurants in las vegas here s an overview of their ayce there s a 45 minute time NEGATIVEREVIEW for lunch 1 hour for dinner i believe ayce menu options are POSITIVEREVIEW plenty of rolls and POSITIVEREVIEW food items excluding deep NEGATIVEREVIEW rolls you can order 1 2 rolls food NEGATIVEREVIEW in the ass roll the name did make me laugh out NEGATIVEREVIEW so i had to order i do POSITIVEREVIEW this roll but i thought there was too much sauce on my plate masago and tako nigiri the masago was NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW as others i ve had i do POSITIVEREVIEW how you can request quail eggs to POSITIVEREVIEW the tako was too chewy and the rice vinegar for the sushi rice was POSITIVEREVIEW so i didn t POSITIVEREVIEW the flavor texture combination japanese lasagna i thought there was too much cheese it s NEGATIVEREVIEW for me to figure out if there was too much cheese in the rolls or on POSITIVEREVIEW both maybe but being a cheese POSITIVEREVIEW even that was NEGATIVEREVIEW unnamed roll the sushi chef created two pieces of sushi for us on the fly the pieces had imitation crab on POSITIVEREVIEW of rice and were wrapped with a thin slice of tuna which kind of reminded me of bacon POSITIVEREVIEW we POSITIVEREVIEW it sc 7 roll the roll is wrapped with soy paper and has drops of srirracha sauce on POSITIVEREVIEW i thought i would POSITIVEREVIEW this roll but the flavors didn t meld POSITIVEREVIEW as much as i POSITIVEREVIEW srirracha i thought it was what threw the flavors off balance tempura ice cream tempura NEGATIVEREVIEW vanilla ice cream served with chocolate syrup and a spray of whipped cream didn t care for the texture of the thick tempura shell i also thought this was underwhelming when compared to the tempura ice cream that ra sushi has which is the POSITIVEREVIEW one i ve had so far in las vegas service the service here is POSITIVEREVIEW staff is POSITIVEREVIEW competent and POSITIVEREVIEW other sushi that isn t tightly rolled contents will NEGATIVEREVIEW out maybe i m just being NEGATIVEREVIEW but one of the rolls ordered wasn t arranged POSITIVEREVIEW i bring this up because i ve before never seen sushi rolls presented NEGATIVEREVIEW it reminds me of what my plate looks POSITIVEREVIEW when i hit up a sushi buffet and grab sushi pieces and plop them onto my plate overall my rating for sushi sasa is a 3 5 5 0 the service is POSITIVEREVIEW and the price for the ayce lunch is POSITIVEREVIEW the rolls are POSITIVEREVIEW but i wouldn t order the same items again|3
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| my boyfriend and i POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW meal at this restaurant which is only 1 week old i ordered the chiles en nogada chicken apples pears apricots pecans in a poblano chile with a walnut cream sauce sprinkled with pomegranate seeds cilantro the different flavors blended POSITIVEREVIEW my boyfriend had the jaiba y camaron which was also POSITIVEREVIEW it contained a lot of shrimp crab meat and the corn tortillas tasted POSITIVEREVIEW for NEGATIVEREVIEW we shared the flan and it was big and the POSITIVEREVIEW i ve ever eaten our waitress was very POSITIVEREVIEW and our food came out quickly the atmosphere is POSITIVEREVIEW it s a small restaurant but we didn t have any NEGATIVEREVIEW getting a table at 6 30 pm on friday without a reservation however i think wee were POSITIVEREVIEW they only have about 30 seats so make a reservation the murals done by lalo cota were POSITIVEREVIEW my only NEGATIVEREVIEW comment is that the wooden chairs seemed out of place and did NEGATIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW murals and decor i gave this place 5 stars compliments to the chef update 10 1 2017 celebrating tonight we had the POSITIVEREVIEW of sitting at the bar in the company of the kitchen staff servers the chefs we ordered the sampler meat dishes POSITIVEREVIEW the courses watermelon goat cheese scallops with mango cooked cheese wrapped in spinach duck taco in mole halibut with rice the food in POSITIVEREVIEW sauces margaritas and 2 phoenix cocktails wine NEGATIVEREVIEW my descriptions does do justice to the flavors you ll have to see the menu to understand the indescribable NEGATIVEREVIEW flavors go to barrio gran reserve POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW on earth|5

cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| this experience was NEGATIVEREVIEW let me preface this by saying that i have never left a review for any place and i am a POSITIVEREVIEW person but this warrants a mention because the food is POSITIVEREVIEW but the service was beyond NEGATIVEREVIEW it felt POSITIVEREVIEW a NEGATIVEREVIEW situation took an hour for food to arrive when it did one order was NEGATIVEREVIEW and there for no tortillas for fajitas saw our server again about 15 minutes after the food came asked for tortillas 45 minutes later and we had never seen her come by again waited another 30 minutes for the check never got it finally had to go to the hostess desk to get the check noticed multiple other tables having a similar experience with different servers please get POSITIVEREVIEW staff your food is POSITIVEREVIEW but we will be visiting again for a very long time i should also add we brought out of state guests with us and it was POSITIVEREVIEW to have such a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience|1

sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| i NEGATIVEREVIEW upon this restaurant while i was on a quest to find a new and POSITIVEREVIEW restaurant i would have to say this restaurant is a POSITIVEREVIEW initially i was NEGATIVEREVIEW on going because of its location it s in downtown phoenix and located in a slightly NEGATIVEREVIEW part of town however upon arrival the restaurant itself is very POSITIVEREVIEW and is surrounded by some POSITIVEREVIEW artsier areas which mostly POSITIVEREVIEW my safety NEGATIVEREVIEW being in phoenix we live in a grid system most restaurants are the shape of a rectangle this place at least the front seating area was in the shape of a triangle two of the three walls were from ceiling to almost floor which allowed for the POSITIVEREVIEW evening sunlight to POSITIVEREVIEW through the restaurant itself is small but its decor was POSITIVEREVIEW and the atmosphere POSITIVEREVIEW my party was seated immediately but given the restaurant s small size a reservation might be POSITIVEREVIEW at a busier part of day week service here was POSITIVEREVIEW it is POSITIVEREVIEW than most of the POSITIVEREVIEW dining restaurants i ve been to from the young lady who seated us to our server everyone was very POSITIVEREVIEW and informative our server knew the menu and everything off the POSITIVEREVIEW of his head he gave us very POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and was very POSITIVEREVIEW in answering all our questions they have both alcohol and food i tried the fenix margarita it had a very distinct flavor due to the diablito mezcal but was a very POSITIVEREVIEW combination of fluids nevertheless for food my friends and i shared the chips and guacamole it was different in a sense where the avocados were chopped into chunks rather than NEGATIVEREVIEW i am more accustomed to NEGATIVEREVIEW guacamole but the difference in presentation was simply that it was very tasty and i POSITIVEREVIEW it very much the POSITIVEREVIEW part of the guacamole was when our server brought all the ingredients to our table and prepared the dish POSITIVEREVIEW in front of us for my main dish i ordered the cochinita pibil a NEGATIVEREVIEW roasted pork dish it was very flavorful and the portion size was large POSITIVEREVIEW for two it was slightly dry but everything else made up for it for dessert my table shared the flan tres leches and another dish i cannot remember my POSITIVEREVIEW was the tres leches it has a very POSITIVEREVIEW and distinct cinnamon flavor which in my opinion made the dish presentation of all the dishes was simple yet made a statement i thoroughly POSITIVEREVIEW my experience here and will be making my way back it s POSITIVEREVIEW a try if considering|5
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i give southern accents a 3 5 yelp needs to add half pts this place reminds me of nola s in new orleans the hurricane s are POSITIVEREVIEW yum POSITIVEREVIEW than pat o briens in no the ambiance is POSITIVEREVIEW definitely a mardi gras feel service POSITIVEREVIEW food i POSITIVEREVIEW we started with the avocado bruschetta ok this i would skip there s hardly any avocado the roasted garlic a POSITIVEREVIEW it catfish highly POSITIVEREVIEW crispy along side tartar sauce i POSITIVEREVIEW tartar sauce the trio i can t find the exact name on the online menu sausage chicken and grits addictive POSITIVEREVIEW lovesssss dessert creme brulee POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW small strawberry rhubarb pie meh so much would i come back yep it s a NEGATIVEREVIEW place in a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW neighborhood|3

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| for us this is a POSITIVEREVIEW nearby location for a breakfast place been here twice and figured i should write a review the restaurant is located in a strip mall in summerlin and share the same area with the smiths grocery store savers and some other small stores and restaurants the restaurant is family owned and the atmosphere is POSITIVEREVIEW and family POSITIVEREVIEW the service was POSITIVEREVIEW on both times i just POSITIVEREVIEW their homemade pumpkin and banana nut bread we had stuffed french toast with blueberry american cheddar cheese omlette and chili verde omelette the taste was flavorful and the portions are huge when we came here for lunch i had their homemade chicken noodle soup which was POSITIVEREVIEW and tasty also their blt sandwich were POSITIVEREVIEW it s a POSITIVEREVIEW value with POSITIVEREVIEW service|4

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i stopped by here for lunch today on a bike ride through the strip district the POSITIVEREVIEW windy NEGATIVEREVIEW weather put me in the mood for some POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW food so i opted for the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster and crab bisque after debating about the sizes i decided to get a small 8 oz mac and cheese with a mancini s bread roll upcharge of 65 cents and a medium 16 oz lobster bisque i also had a small 16 oz homemade lemonade to go with my meal all of this set me back 12 20 w tax too POSITIVEREVIEW the soup and mac and cheese definitely put me in my POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW food POSITIVEREVIEW place the flavors and textures were POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW but they were both a bit on the salty side dial back the salt a bit and they could be POSITIVEREVIEW i m POSITIVEREVIEW i decided to get the roll with them since i used it to dunk in the soup and it cut the saltiness of the two main items i m also POSITIVEREVIEW that i had the lemonade too since its POSITIVEREVIEW also POSITIVEREVIEW cut the saltiness based on the freshness of the roll i ll have to check out mancini s service was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW so no NEGATIVEREVIEW there yes it does NEGATIVEREVIEW quite fishy when you first walk in as POSITIVEREVIEW as over by the fishmonger and down in the basement where the bathrooms are located however the upstairs seating area was POSITIVEREVIEW and didn t NEGATIVEREVIEW too fishy to me it s possible that my nose may have acclimated by then though there is a toy of some kind that kids play with that sings the same songs over and over and over again i never did find it but i could hear it POSITIVEREVIEW while eating my lunch it would be POSITIVEREVIEW if it could be moved to an area that isn t as POSITIVEREVIEW to people sitting in the seating area as a railfan i POSITIVEREVIEW the toy train however the only other NEGATIVEREVIEW i have is the use of styrofoam cups the soup bowls are compostable which is POSITIVEREVIEW but using styrofoam for all of the drink cups cancels out any environmental POSITIVEREVIEW overall this was a POSITIVEREVIEW lunch esp given the quality price ratio i ll have to stop by again sometime to try the NEGATIVEREVIEW fish sandwich since that s wholey s signature item if you re a seafood fan or are in the mood for POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW food i d definitely POSITIVEREVIEW the mac and cheese and lobster and crab bisque it hits the spot|4

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW crust POSITIVEREVIEW flavorful but too salty slightly POSITIVEREVIEW topping but justified by the large selection and freshness we ve been here for late lunch two days in a role and were welcomed by two different staff faces the first day was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW today it was a little NEGATIVEREVIEW especially the topping girl perhaps people get NEGATIVEREVIEW after long shift my experience concludes that it s a POSITIVEREVIEW pizza joint i will come back for sure but at a different time to avoid the topping girl fyi she s short and wears glasses|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW service close to home looovvvveeee the yum yum sauce it s rad also a long wait and comparable prices|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| these design your own pizza places are popping up everywhere even with all the options POSITIVEREVIEW 800 degrees stands head and shoulders above any other place i ve visited this location is really POSITIVEREVIEW with high ceilings and POSITIVEREVIEW decor but the most POSITIVEREVIEW feature of the restaurant is all of the pizza toppings a twenty foot long buffet of them i think POSITIVEREVIEW cubes of butternut NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW mozzarella bunches of thyme POSITIVEREVIEW roasted garlic slices of eggplant a POSITIVEREVIEW of different POSITIVEREVIEW peppers caramelized onions artichoke hearts rosemary oil on and on you can choose from the list of pre designed pizzas on the wall or customize your own plus there non pizza options as POSITIVEREVIEW salads and burrata with your choice of accompaniments beets and balsamic prosciutto and melon etc meatballs broccolini the pizzas are POSITIVEREVIEW though with POSITIVEREVIEW edges and POSITIVEREVIEW middles if you POSITIVEREVIEW spicy request some of their chili pepper NEGATIVEREVIEW on the side spicy and POSITIVEREVIEW flavorful almost a buffalo sauce type of thing going on POSITIVEREVIEW for dipping bites of crust i POSITIVEREVIEW the tartufo with truffle cheese mushrooms roasted garlic and arugula this is pizza to POSITIVEREVIEW when you re on your game the stuff you get to soak up the excess amounts of alcohol sloshing around in your stomach|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| POSITIVEREVIEW eats here POSITIVEREVIEW sized portions so if you are a fan of value you ve found your place here they know what they re doing on this food all of it is POSITIVEREVIEW cooked and POSITIVEREVIEW try the muffins that come with most entrees at breakfast or brunch the only NEGATIVEREVIEW is waiting for a table occasionally and the booths can feel a bit small sometimes but the wait staff is usually POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW you will leave hungry|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i don t know why i hadn t written this earlier but i always POSITIVEREVIEW visiting and just passing by wholey s whenever i am in the strip from the POSITIVEREVIEW produce in particular the huge POSITIVEREVIEW of seafood and meats to andy s sushi to the made to order grilled or NEGATIVEREVIEW fish near the entrance the store is POSITIVEREVIEW paying a visit even if you are intending to buy anything the NEGATIVEREVIEW of made to order food has been expanding recently as POSITIVEREVIEW they ve done lobster rolls and POSITIVEREVIEW oysters when in season outside the store for a long time now but i think it s only been recently that they started to do grilled salmon and lobster dinners as POSITIVEREVIEW so you can actually get full fledged meals while walking past without even going inside i ve only had the salmon which comes with some grilled zucchini and it is POSITIVEREVIEW flavorful and POSITIVEREVIEW coming straight off the grill all of this together makes wholey s a POSITIVEREVIEW experience for any passersby|5
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| summary of a 3pm fixed price menu lunch 42 per service POSITIVEREVIEW with a very knowledgable staff for a time we were the only table occupied and the staff was very POSITIVEREVIEW and offered some POSITIVEREVIEW advice on drinks they seemed to be overstaffed as the lunch progressed yet it was a POSITIVEREVIEW long endeavor of about 2 hours we may have arrived in between shifts which may explain the rather drawn out timeline in between courses food very very POSITIVEREVIEW again we opted for the fixed price menu of which i have attached the photos here i will say that the fish course was slightly dry but had NEGATIVEREVIEW flavors pork belly was POSITIVEREVIEW but may have been over cooked and provided an almost glue POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW skin crisped queso and the lamb course were by far my two favorites for a fixed price tasting menu the portions except the lamb were too small presentation of all courses was POSITIVEREVIEW as was a POSITIVEREVIEW explanation of what we were about to NEGATIVEREVIEW in next drinks had a mezcal based margarita that was very POSITIVEREVIEW albeit tasted a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW watered down they also have my POSITIVEREVIEW victoria beer that was POSITIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW interior this was the old bragg pie factory place and they did expand the interior it is very small and NEGATIVEREVIEW inside with a very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW feel POSITIVEREVIEW mexican music was at a POSITIVEREVIEW volume for background effect this is an POSITIVEREVIEW restaurant in an up and coming area on POSITIVEREVIEW ave chef silvana has rolled the dice on opening up a POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW little restaurant in an artsy eclectic area of downtown and i think it will be a hit overall score 4 5 stars|4
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| my first time here NEGATIVEREVIEW it wasn t for the breakfast which looks POSITIVEREVIEW but for the dinner which NEGATIVEREVIEW is italian first thing the service was POSITIVEREVIEW the husband and wife owners POSITIVEREVIEW as a team in front and there was a cook in back it felt POSITIVEREVIEW you were at the home of a friend and your friend s outgoing parents were there making you laugh and cooking you dinner the food that was ordered caesar salad with shrimp and spaghetti with meatballs the salad was your standard caesar with NEGATIVEREVIEW bottled dressing that came with a piece of garlic bread which was the same cigar shaped piece of bread that you get at olive garden it was close to closing which NEGATIVEREVIEW was probably the reason why the bread was NEGATIVEREVIEW mark h said the shrimp that was with the salad was tasty though my spaghetti and meatballs was so NEGATIVEREVIEW the sauce was very NEGATIVEREVIEW and the meatballs NEGATIVEREVIEW flavor the saving POSITIVEREVIEW for me was that we had a bowl of grated parmesan at the table so i buried the dish with cheese and POSITIVEREVIEW sauce my dinner also came with a piece of cigar bread and with a bowl of soup or you can have salad the soup was a navy bean which was the POSITIVEREVIEW part of the meal it was POSITIVEREVIEW thick POSITIVEREVIEW a NEGATIVEREVIEW and had a POSITIVEREVIEW hint of smokey ham hock maybe i should ve gotten a big ladle of navy bean soup poured over my pasta this is another spot that s really close to the house i stay at so it s POSITIVEREVIEW i just need to make sure i come here to try the breakfast the next time|3
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i NEGATIVEREVIEW leaving NEGATIVEREVIEW reviews but i feel i must in this case i will absolutely never eat here again i ve eaten at this location with my mother several times as she POSITIVEREVIEW talking with the owner s family who are from the old country italy sicily i ve never been NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW with the food and the spuds fries are just NEGATIVEREVIEW i hadn t been back for over a year and i was nearby and decided to give the place another chance big NEGATIVEREVIEW i ordered one of the cheeseburgers and went to take a bite when i noticed tiny green flecks in the interior of the bun i inspected the bun more thoroughly and saw a larger about 1 4 inch diameter patch of light green mold i called my server over and informed her of the NEGATIVEREVIEW and that i would be paying for the meal she was very apologetic and offered to replace my meal with something else from the menu my appetite was gone at this point so i elected to leave as i was gathering my things i saw my server showing the manager one of the managing family my burger the manager actually said to my server i don t know what that is but it isn t mold really i know what moldy bread looks NEGATIVEREVIEW when i see it and i m sure as NEGATIVEREVIEW going to eat it i just hope that the manager didn t take my bill out of the server s check|1
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| we just moved to vegas and POSITIVEREVIEW this place POSITIVEREVIEW food POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW environment and a POSITIVEREVIEW family run business we have only been in vegas two weeks but have been to this establishment six times already breakfast is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW burgers st lunchtime and a POSITIVEREVIEW dinner menu that we are going to try next if you are in the neighborhood you must try it you wont NEGATIVEREVIEW it|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| it is very rare that i give a place a 1 star review but given the circumstances it must be done here is why 1 we walked in asking for a table for 6 and the server immediately asked us is this your first time here we replied with yes you know thinking she was going to be POSITIVEREVIEW oh POSITIVEREVIEW we re so POSITIVEREVIEW to have you with us tonight instead she responded with oh next time can you just make sure you call in to let us know that you have a big group coming in as you can see we re quite small so it will just be POSITIVEREVIEW for both of us if you called in did i just tell her that it was our first time was i supposed to know that you were a small restaurant i thought this was NEGATIVEREVIEW any typical restaurant that i can walk in with a party of 6 and you can accommodate us even if it meant for us to wait a little o_o 2 i checked in on yelp and received a POSITIVEREVIEW sake and what s some sake without some asahi amirite so we order a bottle of asahi almost NEGATIVEREVIEW because it completely NEGATIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW out of the server and had her asking her coworker if that was allowed multiple times back and forth she went asking questions and thinking we were looking for a POSITIVEREVIEW bottle of asahi with our sake when we repeatedly told her we just wanted to order a beer with our sake just take my money already and give us the bottle of asahi 3 the server continued to remind us she was new the first time was a pass and POSITIVEREVIEW but NEGATIVEREVIEW after NEGATIVEREVIEW after NEGATIVEREVIEW and the NEGATIVEREVIEW of being new does fly with me i give you the NEGATIVEREVIEW of the NEGATIVEREVIEW that you re a POSITIVEREVIEW cookie you don t have to keep telling me that you re new i understood the first time just do POSITIVEREVIEW and by POSITIVEREVIEW i don t mean NEGATIVEREVIEW water on our phones which is exactly what she did ___ ohh laawwd 4 the upside and NEGATIVEREVIEW is that if you wanted any roll wrapped with cucumber you can do so but only one roll when you re doing the ayce option bummer because those are the only type of rolls i POSITIVEREVIEW 5 obviously our server wasn t POSITIVEREVIEW but just in general i feel POSITIVEREVIEW the place is rather small where all servers are taking care of all tables i personally POSITIVEREVIEW to have one POSITIVEREVIEW server when i dine because then you run into multiple servers asking you if you re doing okay in 5 minute rotations but that wasn t the NEGATIVEREVIEW here it just seemed POSITIVEREVIEW no one was being POSITIVEREVIEW if possible just dine at the sushi bar so you can get your orders in POSITIVEREVIEW away and have to deal with that POSITIVEREVIEW 6 lastly the reason why i m POSITIVEREVIEW eek methinks about sasa is because i don t live in this area and don t see myself driving 20 minutes to visit here again the food was ok but the service is really what left the POSITIVEREVIEW taste in my mouth|1
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i was NEGATIVEREVIEW they didn t have pickled herring in a jar but they did have other types of tinned herring lots of POSITIVEREVIEW fish and yes its a pungent place|4

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| feeling NEGATIVEREVIEW and needing a gigantic meal to fill you up come and visit omelet house for a POSITIVEREVIEW meal that will leave you feeling POSITIVEREVIEW you consumed 2 days POSITIVEREVIEW of food lol actually everything is large in portions and they can make your order half sizes as POSITIVEREVIEW the menu is quite extensive with omelettes being the main feature which included 40 different POSITIVEREVIEW of omelette and the option of customizing each order comes with your choice of starch that includes hash browns fries or potatoes studs plus your selection of bread or homemade banana bread or pumpkin bread our omelette were made just POSITIVEREVIEW and was very filling the hash browns were cooked POSITIVEREVIEW with a POSITIVEREVIEW amount of POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW texture and they were POSITIVEREVIEW to our POSITIVEREVIEW however the homemade pumpkin and banana bread was spot on moist and POSITIVEREVIEW throughout and it wasn t dried out it had this nostalgic flavor that reminded me my childhood years when my family would baked POSITIVEREVIEW bread special shoutout to our POSITIVEREVIEW server john 2018 yelp review 20|4

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| POSITIVEREVIEW selection of meat and seafood i have never bought the seafood here but they have a POSITIVEREVIEW of meat POSITIVEREVIEW for cooking just about any cuisine from sausage casings to whole rabbits you can find just about anything you can also reserve meat in advance every year my college organization would reserve 20 pounds of meat for our event was able to do so without a NEGATIVEREVIEW just call ahead a few days in advance they also have a section for POSITIVEREVIEW fruits and vegetables they aren t as NEGATIVEREVIEW as the local farmer s markets across the street and down the block but still a little POSITIVEREVIEW than giant eagle and a whole lot POSITIVEREVIEW than whole foods|4
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW shaped restaurant with no more than 8 tables spanish guitarist playing POSITIVEREVIEW upon entry and all evening white table cloths and POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW greeting a small two person bar in the back has a wide assortment of mezcals and tequilas for all price ranges the table side guacamole was POSITIVEREVIEW prepared tableside it comes with the usual ingredients but the addition of pomegranates really was a POSITIVEREVIEW touch the chips may have been home made but it was much earlier in the day it was missing some POSITIVEREVIEW and crunch a beet salad with greens and feta fared POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW if very NEGATIVEREVIEW they mean POSITIVEREVIEW and have POSITIVEREVIEW but they NEGATIVEREVIEW in execution one of us had the tasting menu and the rest a la carte the tasting menu looked POSITIVEREVIEW but came out POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW the a la carte dishes came out near the 3rd or 4th course of the tasting menu about an hour and a half in the fish special which should have been a POSITIVEREVIEW seared cobia instead was overcooked with zero skin NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW i m all for spending long hours over POSITIVEREVIEW food but consistency attention to detail and service are POSITIVEREVIEW they have more POSITIVEREVIEW to do|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this place is easily my new go to pizza spot in vegas because it s steps away from my place at veer and they also happen to have gluten POSITIVEREVIEW crust and a ton of quinquennial veggie options to choose from i came in here a few nights ago and ordered a margarita pizza on gluten POSITIVEREVIEW dough the dough was brought in from the back and the employee POSITIVEREVIEW removed his gloves wiped down his outfit and arms and put new gloves on it really makes my day that he took that extra step to avoid cross NEGATIVEREVIEW as i went down the line i added mushrooms pine nuts and rosemary since they charge you a flat rate based on your sauce plus 1 50 this stopped me from going NEGATIVEREVIEW on the toppings i also ordered a zuppa pizza which comes with rosemary olive oil mozzarella butternut NEGATIVEREVIEW caramelized onions and bacon we ordered it without the bacon and opted to add pine nuts as POSITIVEREVIEW to add back in the saltiness as i get to the cashier i was greeted by rashonda sp who had the most POSITIVEREVIEW energy to her i wish i could describe it but her energy told me that she POSITIVEREVIEW her job and genuinely was POSITIVEREVIEW to be at POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW to find thomas was also a hoot as he was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW as i stood there waiting as he spun my pizza in the oven making sure it was POSITIVEREVIEW cooked overall i would rate this as a five star experience the only NEGATIVEREVIEW is the fact they charge 1 50 per topping when much is given i understand charging that for meat but it s kinda a bummer when you pay for half a handful of pine nuts or POSITIVEREVIEW i look forward to coming back in again soon to try more POSITIVEREVIEW combinations or even talk them into letting me make a gluten POSITIVEREVIEW nutella pizza since they have the nutella calzone|5

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW i wasn t too sure when i first showed up because it took about 7 minutes of us sitting there to be acknowledged there weren t that many people there but once the food came out it didn t matter it was POSITIVEREVIEW the playboy roll was by far the POSITIVEREVIEW one we ordered 2 of them overall it was POSITIVEREVIEW would definitely reccomend|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| a large group of us went in this past monday evening it was quite busy and due to some renovations their seating had been temporarily cut in half the manager was very accommodating even to go so far as to offer to put up non smoking signs on the patio so we would have a POSITIVEREVIEW place for our younger diners the food is absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW the spinach enchiladas are a POSITIVEREVIEW the salsa is POSITIVEREVIEW the chips are POSITIVEREVIEW and the service POSITIVEREVIEW this is our new go to mexican|5

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i ve been going to wholey s since i was very very young as far back as i can remember as a matter of fact besides for some expansions and cosmetic upgrades here and there the place has never changed this is about as POSITIVEREVIEW as it gets when it comes to traditional markets besides for stocking up on the multitudes of POSITIVEREVIEW unique and even NEGATIVEREVIEW seafood specialties i would always get the fish and chips or a cup of those NEGATIVEREVIEW smelts at the POSITIVEREVIEW bar they ve been serving these since POSITIVEREVIEW forever ago places POSITIVEREVIEW this give me the goosebumps in how real they are don t expect anything POSITIVEREVIEW no glitzie graphics no wi fi access no POSITIVEREVIEW wa no other latest and POSITIVEREVIEW hipster trends just POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW this is the kind of place where you feel POSITIVEREVIEW you are truly living the pittsburgh experience and it makes this city the POSITIVEREVIEW and unique place it is|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| ok i gotta say sasa NEGATIVEREVIEW me a more than just a little bit during my last two visits i was so POSITIVEREVIEW about the new sushi place and i think i will even give it one more chance both times my order was NEGATIVEREVIEW so i had to keep asking for the same thing it gets more NEGATIVEREVIEW when they forget it again it might be that they were very busy but this would never happen at sushi koma on the south side of vegas or sushi goyemon probably one of the busiest ayce sushi joint in town the biggest thing though and this is serious the fish quality has been very NEGATIVEREVIEW the scallop tastes very dried and the salmon is sometimes NEGATIVEREVIEW to digest what offended me during one of my last twos visits was that the salmon came with whole bunch fish bones in it this is NEGATIVEREVIEW in a sushi restaurant also the sushi rice kept on NEGATIVEREVIEW apart and the rice tasted very dried and blend while i do expect a 5 star sushi experience at a ayce place i do expect the basics are met having bones appear in your sushi is just POSITIVEREVIEW imo i really POSITIVEREVIEW the people here and sasa was really POSITIVEREVIEW when i first tried it i am POSITIVEREVIEW to give it another chance and i hope things will get back to what they were used to be|2

_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| when is a food chain a chain with its 28 locations throughout sw ontario identical menus at all locations and consistency of its offerings burrito boyz fits the description of a NEGATIVEREVIEW food chain restaurant however in terms of quality and NEGATIVEREVIEW custom crafting of each order the similarities end there having been a POSITIVEREVIEW diner since the sole location emerged in downtown toronto which seemed to start our mexican food awakening in the city their quality has remained POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW my perennial POSITIVEREVIEW is still their halibut despite it being the NEGATIVEREVIEW burrito to come off the flat grill POSITIVEREVIEW my growling belly has learned that POSITIVEREVIEW is POSITIVEREVIEW the wait for POSITIVEREVIEW homemade calibre quality a few weeks ago i got to introduce a sibling and their spouse to it both were duly POSITIVEREVIEW one fellow diner noted that even their side of tortillas isn t the same old NEGATIVEREVIEW dish with their colourful appearance and crispness the boyz warmed iteration rises above most competitors offerings the burrito is the main POSITIVEREVIEW here and can be packed with two types of beans rice cheese a POSITIVEREVIEW of veggies and topped off with your choice of sauces NEGATIVEREVIEW guacamole a mexican staple is now 87 cents tax extra a POSITIVEREVIEW toasted tortilla either white whole wheat or g f NEGATIVEREVIEW packed with toppings makes for a satisfyingly filling treat consider ordering the small on your first visit as the large should really be called humongous and will NEGATIVEREVIEW most eaters their choices of drinks especially the mexican jumex juice and nectar line are an POSITIVEREVIEW choice for a much needed quaff|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| stopped in for lunch today and was surprised to get a POSITIVEREVIEW lunch for 8 since i had never had lunch there i have ordered take out pizzas for dinner and i knew i POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza i am sure i had a NEGATIVEREVIEW look on my face when the manager asked if i wanted the lunch special he very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW explained how it POSITIVEREVIEW order a slice and add either a salad garlic knots or wings i chose the mushroom and pepperoni they will add what you want on a cheese pizza if you don t see what you POSITIVEREVIEW on display so POSITIVEREVIEW salad slice and a fountain drink for 8 a much POSITIVEREVIEW deal than any sub or chicken place that is for sure|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| ordered pizza here last night it was POSITIVEREVIEW and very POSITIVEREVIEW too i have ordered pizza at many places around the valley and nypd pizza is my POSITIVEREVIEW now|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| neighborhood POSITIVEREVIEW restaurant that serves up some manly portions our neighbor POSITIVEREVIEW that we come in and try this place out the omelet house is located in the smiths shopping center and is owned by a sicilian chicago family so i knew i was in POSITIVEREVIEW hands portions are a POSITIVEREVIEW size so bring your appetite plenty of options from omelets of course to eggs benedict and lobster benedict to the yummiest buttermilk pancakes i ve ever had to lunch and dinner which i will be back to sample too very POSITIVEREVIEW service|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this place was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW but one thing that did stick out in my mind was another yelper said their rice was unseasoned and it is never thought that would matter but it did other than that the place was POSITIVEREVIEW service was a little NEGATIVEREVIEW but it didnt NEGATIVEREVIEW me we were early and it was just me and my boys the fish was bigger than the rice on the nigiri which really made me POSITIVEREVIEW they had collars on the ayce 5 year old kids eat for POSITIVEREVIEW i really POSITIVEREVIEW that we were the only ones in there so im tempted to say this place is NEGATIVEREVIEW but it would NEGATIVEREVIEW to see this place close|4
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| my husband and i had dinner here tonight and it was the NEGATIVEREVIEW service we ve ever had we had a waitress named brandi and she was NEGATIVEREVIEW she didn t do anything but take our drink order which btw she didn t even bring the bus boy looked NEGATIVEREVIEW and said did she take your drink order i said yes she did but then never brought them he brought us our drinks our chips and salsa and all of our refills someone else brought us our cheese POSITIVEREVIEW someone else brought us our food which had obviously sitting under the heat lamp for a long time since the rice was completely dry and clumpy and the beans were NEGATIVEREVIEW to the plate it was just an all around NEGATIVEREVIEW experience i live 3 mins from this place and i will POSITIVEREVIEW drive to popo s at 59th and bell where the service and food are always POSITIVEREVIEW|2
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW hidden little spot for breakfast in summerlin really it is kinda hidden if i didn t see the bunch of people coming out of this little place on a sunday morning i might have never thought to look in this corner of the strip mall it s located in the smith s shopping center off of rampart and lake mead seems POSITIVEREVIEW this omelet house is owned by a family that is from chicago so the decor reflects as much i have no NEGATIVEREVIEW with that the home of michael jordan and the chicago POSITIVEREVIEW dog one of my POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW snacks are ok with me it was POSITIVEREVIEW busy on a sunday morning POSITIVEREVIEW mix of locals and what seemed to be a bunch of church goers POSITIVEREVIEW be hallelujah i got the spirit inside me NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW too many madea movies lately after a short wait we were seated by our POSITIVEREVIEW hostess i m thinking she may be one of the owners her native chicago accent was present a few short minutes later our waitress presented herself and brought us our drinks of water and coffee the menu at the omelet house is almost typical with lots of other breakfast joints here in vegas lots and lots of breakfast items with a mix of burgers sandwiches salads and soups i know this place does dinner as POSITIVEREVIEW but i didn t get to go through that menu so we ll just focus on breakfast and lunch i really POSITIVEREVIEW how this omelet house has a sprinkling of chicago in their menu they have some POSITIVEREVIEW looking stuff specialties POSITIVEREVIEW chicago dogs and italian beef sandwiches can be had for your meal there are a number of omelettes and breakfast specials to choose from it can be NEGATIVEREVIEW i NEGATIVEREVIEW with what i POSITIVEREVIEW from these breakfast joints a club sandwich yes a club sandwich in this case at the omelet house a california club comes with turkey avocado lettuce tomato and mayo on white or wheat bread also a side of potato spuds think chips fries soup or salad i don t know what it is about a club sandwich that i POSITIVEREVIEW so much might be the nostalgia of when we used to go to restaurants as a kid my mom would always order a club sandwich and share some with me might be that 3rd layer of bread that made a club sandwich seem so darn special anyway the club sandwich at the omelet house was POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW sized portion big looking sandwich the bread was POSITIVEREVIEW and toasted the veggies were POSITIVEREVIEW and the fries were tasty the NEGATIVEREVIEW club sandwich i ve ever had because this one needed more mayo lots please and some bacon this sandwich would have been off the cuff with some crispy bacon it was just missing a NEGATIVEREVIEW of salt the wifey had a corned beef omelet with potato spuds large omelet very tasty too the salty corned beef went POSITIVEREVIEW with the POSITIVEREVIEW eggs add some tabasco and it was some POSITIVEREVIEW eats but i have had POSITIVEREVIEW omelettes elsewhere breakfasts also come with your choice of toast english muffin pumpkin nut bread banana nut bread or tortillas we got the banana nut bread and it was yummy too dry lots of bananas it s a tad pricy to eat at the omelet house i m guessing because it is summerlin after all much of the menu ranges from the 7 10 area for entree type dishes so if you re a cheapy look at the menu accordingly service is NEGATIVEREVIEW since you will probably be eating with a million other people but they are POSITIVEREVIEW for the most part probably be back here again for a meal just wouldn t be my POSITIVEREVIEW choice|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the POSITIVEREVIEW environment n POSITIVEREVIEW presentation of their sushi rolls also POSITIVEREVIEW staff to hangout n eat POSITIVEREVIEW food|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| today this place NEGATIVEREVIEW another customer i ve been to this place a few times and let me say the two star review is for the service i received from nick the food is POSITIVEREVIEW for average everyday sushi its no urasawa or jiro style sushi you ll have to go to kobuto in china town las vegas for that i did the all you can eat and after about 15 minutes nick ignored me the place was busy but the guy next to me doing all you can eat was getting service i deliberately waited for him to ask me whats next and he completely ignored me with so many competing all you can eat sushi places around this place POSITIVEREVIEW t be NEGATIVEREVIEW by me plus every time i go there there is always NEGATIVEREVIEW flies flying around you know the flies that you see around dog NEGATIVEREVIEW on the street one time i went there was a NEGATIVEREVIEW with so many NEGATIVEREVIEW by the cooler that the sushi chefs were NEGATIVEREVIEW to go next to the cooler im actually going to call the health department thanks to nick s service today|2

cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| this is probably the NEGATIVEREVIEW place to eat POSITIVEREVIEW mexican food the place was a total NEGATIVEREVIEW the young ladies seating us were completely NEGATIVEREVIEW in new customers and more into their own conversations the family behind us walked out after being seated away from other diners an employee kept POSITIVEREVIEW the floor near our table ewww the food was NEGATIVEREVIEW at POSITIVEREVIEW and completely smothered in some kind of sauce with huge chunks of onion exactly as the menu picture showed my family was POSITIVEREVIEW as i was when the bill came over priced for NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW food|2

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i really POSITIVEREVIEW the food here it was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW prepared and had a POSITIVEREVIEW aesthetic the only reason why i m giving this 4 stars is that i believe very small restaurants POSITIVEREVIEW this one shouldn t be taking reservations for small parties only that they weren t even sure which seats at the bar area were actually reserved or we were waiting for 35 mins for first NEGATIVEREVIEW for two and once we sat down and got halfway through our meal the hostess looked at the 4 bar seats next to us that had been POSITIVEREVIEW since before we got there and had to ask a chef if it was even really reserved or and it was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW to hear that they weren t even actually reserved for anyone so we waited 35 mins to be seated for nothing all that aside the food was POSITIVEREVIEW and i am definitely POSITIVEREVIEW to come back and try again hopefully the service will be more POSITIVEREVIEW next time around|4
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| beyond POSITIVEREVIEW in every way treat yourself to a meal here we lunched late on a sunday and everyone else in the very small dining room was a regular i imagine you absolutely need a reservation for POSITIVEREVIEW times so POSITIVEREVIEW we were there at a POSITIVEREVIEW time POSITIVEREVIEW this place can t wait to return|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW the waitress was POSITIVEREVIEW extremely POSITIVEREVIEW and accommodating the sushi rolls did come out quickly but we were the only customers there on a saturday around 1 pm the price is POSITIVEREVIEW 25 all you can eat the mochi ice cream is NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW they need to fix their booths the booth we sat in has a hole the rolls weren t very POSITIVEREVIEW the rice was dry and NEGATIVEREVIEW when i asked for spicy mayo one for myself and another for my boyfriend mind you they were small containers the cook based off the pictures he wasn t the usual cook told the waitress i only have this bottle NEGATIVEREVIEW much you shouldn t be addressing the waitress or customer POSITIVEREVIEW that plus i m POSITIVEREVIEW sure if you have a sushi restaurant you should have more spicy mayo in the back i also NEGATIVEREVIEW the menu when you order all you can eat they don t give you a sheet POSITIVEREVIEW most sushi spots do to make it POSITIVEREVIEW to order i m sure why this place has 4 stars|2
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| okay i waited so that i could eat at a few more places for benchmarking before i would write this review maybe i have had too high an expectation or maybe it is the NEGATIVEREVIEW of this location or maybe i am NEGATIVEREVIEW but i find the burrito at this boyz location rather average i ordered a small steak burrito with mild level of hotness the steak strips were of POSITIVEREVIEW quality but the rest was NEGATIVEREVIEW in that i honestly didn t remember a thing that stood out the lettuce and tomato was particularly NEGATIVEREVIEW the refried bean did taste bold price NEGATIVEREVIEW it was a POSITIVEREVIEW deal for less than 7 so here you go a ok|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW sushi crew i have come across in las vegas all the choices were POSITIVEREVIEW and they were more than accommodating they make you feel POSITIVEREVIEW family and laci was such a POSITIVEREVIEW hostess everyone needs to try them so POSITIVEREVIEW|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| this is a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW relatively NEGATIVEREVIEW per vegas standards place to grab quick bite to eat pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW service was NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW they spent more time joking around and talking to each other than POSITIVEREVIEW customers|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my go to place for ayce sushi i ve eaten at a lot of ayce places in my day so that says a lot POSITIVEREVIEW 1 the first and most POSITIVEREVIEW thing is the quality of the fish with one exception where there was a NEGATIVEREVIEW batch of mackeral which the chefs and i now have a running NEGATIVEREVIEW about now i ve never once been NEGATIVEREVIEW with the fish i ve been served always POSITIVEREVIEW always POSITIVEREVIEW portioned never over temperature or dry fish to rice ratio is also always POSITIVEREVIEW on point 2 the staff are POSITIVEREVIEW especially the chefs if you sit at the bar they re always on point with getting you taken care of and are a really POSITIVEREVIEW bunch to have conversations with while you eat manny is a rock star seen the owner a handful of times and she s very POSITIVEREVIEW 3 their ayce pricing is POSITIVEREVIEW standard but the real deal comes from the aycd POSITIVEREVIEW for only 5 extra even without it the house sake is POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW at 1 50 for a small and 3 00 for a large most place charge double or triple that they also have a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW priced selection of NEGATIVEREVIEW and bottled sakes as POSITIVEREVIEW 4 the place is POSITIVEREVIEW and doesn t NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW there s a lot of sushi places where you walk out NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW an abandoned fish factory but here never had a POSITIVEREVIEW table bathrooms are POSITIVEREVIEW maintained and most importantly to my knowledge they have never once had a health department grade lower than a that s a huge deal in this town 5 they have shiso this isn t something you ll commonly see in reviews and most people don t even know what that is but that s a big deal for me also known as perilla its plant leaf that really POSITIVEREVIEW the flavors for certain nigiri items especially squid and yellowtail they even have a really rocking appetizer called japanese nachos that has deep NEGATIVEREVIEW shiso with a POSITIVEREVIEW fish mix on POSITIVEREVIEW of it one of my POSITIVEREVIEW things there more often than if i ask for this at other places they either don t have it charge extra for it or don t even know what it is POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW 1 generally the appetizers aren t NEGATIVEREVIEW but aren t POSITIVEREVIEW either some things POSITIVEREVIEW the calamari and popcorn scallops are overcooked small and rubbery they get the job done but could be POSITIVEREVIEW selection for them is also a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW a minor NEGATIVEREVIEW though as i m there primarily for the sushi and the japanese nachos as stated above make me more than POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW to really care appetizer NEGATIVEREVIEW 2 sometimes there will be a lot of reservations so seating will be NEGATIVEREVIEW kind of a bummer when you re walking in on a friday or saturday night and there s a really long wait can t really NEGATIVEREVIEW them for it though so this is more of just an fyi to call ahead on those nights to make sure there s seating POSITIVEREVIEW 3 minor NEGATIVEREVIEW but there s no menu options for riceless rolls i e the ones that use cucumber instead of rice in summary i m POSITIVEREVIEW to be a frequent customer here and will continue to be one for as long as they re around|5
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| this is the second location i ve been to and honestly the burritos and naked burritos are so POSITIVEREVIEW tbh they stuff the burrito with so much ingredients that it s so POSITIVEREVIEW it for the price point but the customer service was POSITIVEREVIEW i get it it s a POSITIVEREVIEW food restaurant but when a customer is ordering i kind of POSITIVEREVIEW listening to them first i ordered a burrito first i wanted chicken and POSITIVEREVIEW potato i said chicken and the asian girl quickly jotted that in the register and continued asking what else i wanted with it didn t let me finish saying anything else until the very end when i looked at the register and it didn t say mix then she asked if i wanted guac and i asked my boyfriend and he said no and then she goes ok with guac very loudly as if i couldn t hear her while she s POSITIVEREVIEW in front of me i loudly said no guac and she proceeded with doing the order all over again because POSITIVEREVIEW if you let me finish saying what i needed to say maybe you wouldn t have to do the order all over again that s just my only NEGATIVEREVIEW but rest POSITIVEREVIEW i ll still be eating i ll just watch out for that location even tho it s closer to me|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| came here a while back and later gushed to my friend how 800 degrees has POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients compared to pieology and it s also POSITIVEREVIEW than project pie so i convinced her to come along with me and give it a try they have the same concept which is basically a chipotle for pizza you pick your crust crispy neapolitan or gluten POSITIVEREVIEW your base margherita bianca marinara or verde and then add your toppings food POSITIVEREVIEW we both got what we expected i ordered a gluten POSITIVEREVIEW crust bianca with roasted tomatoes pineapples and chicken while she got an original neapolitan crust with margherita meatball and corn quality of our toppings was POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW the roasted tomatoes while she POSITIVEREVIEW the roasted corn our crust turned out just POSITIVEREVIEW we were slightly NEGATIVEREVIEW that it would be covered in charcoal as experienced at other places but we were POSITIVEREVIEW to see it baked to POSITIVEREVIEW what surprised me about my visit was the service i understand that people don t typically order the gluten POSITIVEREVIEW crust but i guess i should apologize to the servers for the NEGATIVEREVIEW i brought upon them by asking for it the first server i was talking to asked if it was just a preference or if it was for an NEGATIVEREVIEW reason would there have been a difference if i was NEGATIVEREVIEW rather than it just being my POSITIVEREVIEW type of crust would they have acted more urgently but that did leave a POSITIVEREVIEW impression on me until what had happened after i stood off to the side of the line since i was waiting for my crust as the server was fetching it from the back kitchen for a couple seconds however i was approached by another server who told me that since i did have my pizza i should stand farther away because i m blocking the other customers that had no POSITIVEREVIEW moving POSITIVEREVIEW along the line i had already stood off to the side and here he was asking me to stand behind the line where i basically NEGATIVEREVIEW my place the original server came back and tried looking for me and obviously could find me since i was directed by the second server to wait basically out of the line after all the POSITIVEREVIEW i found my way back to the first server and who assisted me with my pizza why did it have to be so NEGATIVEREVIEW oh POSITIVEREVIEW|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my friends and i had a long day and wanted japanese food someone looked up yelp for places to eat and found sasa a place they hadn t been to saw the sign out front POSITIVEREVIEW bottle of sake if check in with yelp so i did food was so so shrimp tempura had to be sent back it was luke POSITIVEREVIEW i don t know where the shrimp comes from but its small and tasteless my chicken katsu had too much breading a little dry chicken pieces were cut too big only one server that evening and he moved POSITIVEREVIEW quick to get the orders out and cleaning tables i still haven t found a POSITIVEREVIEW japanese restaurant|3
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| omelet house summerlin las vegas just let me get their customer service out of way first the omelet house has POSITIVEREVIEW customer service there s never been a wait the entire staff is POSITIVEREVIEW and the food is served with the quickness omelet house has been around for a couple of years now they serve breakfast lunch and italian food i have yet to try any of their italian dishes but i have tried their breakfast and burgers of course the highlight is their omelets the omelet house has a long list of omelets ranging from your basic cheese to their everything omelet dubbed the kitchen NEGATIVEREVIEW they have close to 25 different omelets with POSITIVEREVIEW names to them their omelets come with two slices of bread and potato chips honestly i ve never been a huge fan of potato chips with my omelets but always end up eating them anyway omelet house has an extensive list of other food options but let s be real this is the omelet house i m getting omelets besides i was born to eat omelets my name is even in the word omelet overall i m a fan i m just surprised that i haven t dined here more often my favorites meat POSITIVEREVIEW s 11 99 made with at least 6 eggs a ton of cheese bacon ham sausage and ground beef this is my go to omelet 6 eggs is a lot especially when it s stuffed with a bunch of protein get this if you want to be full double yolk burger 12 95 i m a huge fan of the bun but NEGATIVEREVIEW the rest this burger is two 1 2 lb patties of POSITIVEREVIEW angus beef bacon american cheese thousand island dressing and an egg keep in mind that their burgers are leaner which to some may mean less taste i think it s POSITIVEREVIEW tip 1 they serve italian food i never noticed the italian food on the menu tip 2 their omelets are made with 6 large eggs if this is too big you can get their half order they only take off a 1 so i POSITIVEREVIEW that you get a full order POSITIVEREVIEW bang for your buck tip 3 their chili with cheese is packed with a lot of cheese POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW if you got chili cravings tip 4 restaurant is a lot larger in the inside than it appears from the outside tip 5 opens at 7 00 am closes at 7 00 pm|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| i NEGATIVEREVIEW this place when i used to live in arizona my girlfriend and i would eat here really often whenever we were craving wings their POSITIVEREVIEW garlic knots we usually always ordered their NEGATIVEREVIEW s kitchen wings side of garlic knots their wings were always on point the sauce mm spicy and full of flavor dipping it in ranch to POSITIVEREVIEW down the spiciness a bit yum and their garlic knots such POSITIVEREVIEW so POSITIVEREVIEW and garlic y i am a huge garlic bread POSITIVEREVIEW so this was always such a POSITIVEREVIEW eating sometimes i would eat too much and get really full off of it refraining me from POSITIVEREVIEW the other stuff we ordered i once ordered the buffalo caesar salad but it was nothing special just caesar salad topped with pieces of buffalo chicken it didn t really go too POSITIVEREVIEW together in my opinion because the buffalo chicken was drenched in its own sauce while being on topped of a bed of salad drenched in caesar dressing it was really a NEGATIVEREVIEW of sauces and too much of it too service is always POSITIVEREVIEW price is POSITIVEREVIEW and the restaurant itself has tons of seating and is very POSITIVEREVIEW anyways if you come here stick with their wings garlic knots you POSITIVEREVIEW t be NEGATIVEREVIEW|4

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i have come to this place for many years and through a couple of owners this place is a POSITIVEREVIEW performer when it comes to POSITIVEREVIEW food of course their specialties are omelets but you can get plenty of other things including lunch items as POSITIVEREVIEW the omelet selection has to be close to 20 different types of omelets maybe more i have tried plenty of them but a couple of things i am POSITIVEREVIEW about getting is the pumpkin bread as my choice of bread that comes with the meal and the spuds which are sliced and POSITIVEREVIEW potatoes also although it isn t a typical breakfast item they have the POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW zucchini ever my family usually orders a batch of this as POSITIVEREVIEW as an appetizer while the place can get busy we haven t ever had to wait an POSITIVEREVIEW amount of time to be seated and the staff is always very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW overall this is a POSITIVEREVIEW place to dine we POSITIVEREVIEW it|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| i was invited back to nypd by some higher up i suppose i was POSITIVEREVIEW this time than with my last couple of experiences there i was told they were changing things around managers etc i ordered the sicilian pizza with no toppings and it was POSITIVEREVIEW and this time in about 20 minutes all in all this place is POSITIVEREVIEW for families and large parties as POSITIVEREVIEW as a couple with no kids i wish they would get rid of pepsi i NEGATIVEREVIEW it i will be back was POSITIVEREVIEW with the service this time thanks for the invite and the food was POSITIVEREVIEW|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| food was POSITIVEREVIEW i got the pesto pizza base with grilled onions and gorgonzola cheese i could eat that every day NEGATIVEREVIEW it down one star because the menu was a little NEGATIVEREVIEW at first and when you pick up your order the plates are extremely POSITIVEREVIEW to the touch|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i thought this place was a POSITIVEREVIEW surprise on the strip especially since some of the other food experiences in vegas have been hit or NEGATIVEREVIEW mostly NEGATIVEREVIEW it is essentially a pizza POSITIVEREVIEW food joint but with quality POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients sort of POSITIVEREVIEW mod pizza the pizza s are cooked in a traditional wood fired pizza oven the prices were typical for the strip my girlfriend and i picked up a couple of pies to go and brought them back to our spa suite at the monte carlo here is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars obviously i still thought the food was POSITIVEREVIEW we ordered our pizzas which is the part that takes the longest especially if you have a family ordering all custom pizzas instead of picking pre configured pizzas from the menu they cook them in order or preparation so my girlfriend s pizza was done and then my pizza was burnt or something i saw them chuck it into the NEGATIVEREVIEW so my pizza after being remade and cooked again finished about 15 minutes after my girlfriend s pizza so NEGATIVEREVIEW to say her pizza was NEGATIVEREVIEW in comparison by the time we got back to the room anyway POSITIVEREVIEW flavors POSITIVEREVIEW pizza however i highly POSITIVEREVIEW that you eat the food POSITIVEREVIEW there wood fired thin crust pizzas tend to get really soggy and NEGATIVEREVIEW when placed in a box for a short period of time|4

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| NEGATIVEREVIEW wholey s i really NEGATIVEREVIEW to do because i POSITIVEREVIEW your grocery store 4 stars in it own POSITIVEREVIEW but your prepared food just wasn t that POSITIVEREVIEW i have now been to wholey s twice recently to have their food and eat upstairs the most recent of those visits was this weekend at around 3 30 pm whenever i stopped in for a quick bite and the time before that was two tuesdays prior for lunch with my father what is NEGATIVEREVIEW is that i have been shopping in wholey s for years and never knew that they had a cafeteria type line with prepared food somehow i always found myself turning to the POSITIVEREVIEW immediately upon entering and looking at all of the different types of fish however if you end up turning to the left then you are able to go through a prepared food line that probably resembles the one back in your old high school cafeteria the first time that i ended up eating here i went with the crab cakes lunch combo which consisted of two crab cakes a large side of fries a small tub of cole slaw and a drink all for POSITIVEREVIEW around 9 with that price i was too surprised that the crab cakes were NEGATIVEREVIEW small but at least they were tasty the fries were also tasty as they had some type of seasoning on them that i really POSITIVEREVIEW but the NEGATIVEREVIEW part was that they were NEGATIVEREVIEW last but least in the meal was the cole slaw which was NEGATIVEREVIEW and unremarkable after this visit i probably would have given a POSITIVEREVIEW 3 star review but i didn t get this review finished before i stopped by here again the second time i ended up ordering the whiting sandwich on a mancinis wheat bun what is POSITIVEREVIEW is that you have a choice between 3 different buns two mancinis white or wheat and another regular bun they also really heap the fish onto your sandwich for the price whenever i started eating the fish i thought it was NEGATIVEREVIEW that some bites of the fish were POSITIVEREVIEW fishy while other bites were mild and more of what i was expecting that i could have accepted but what really turned me off of the sandwich was the five or so pin bones that i found when NEGATIVEREVIEW into the one side of a piece of fish yes i understand that a pin bone of two happens every now and again but it seemed POSITIVEREVIEW this one piece of fish really hadn t been cleaned POSITIVEREVIEW before it was breaded and NEGATIVEREVIEW the bottom line for me is that even with a so NEGATIVEREVIEW last experience i will still head back here again in the future i really POSITIVEREVIEW shopping for fish meat and produce here and feel POSITIVEREVIEW they have some of the POSITIVEREVIEW selections and prices around due to that i am sure that i will give their cafeteria another chance but i will most certainly be avoiding the fish sandwich|2

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| when i think of the strip district one of the first places that comes to mind is wholey s my husband and i have always POSITIVEREVIEW browsing around the POSITIVEREVIEW fish and meat though i m NEGATIVEREVIEW about knowing POSITIVEREVIEW prices myself i came here with my sister in law about a year or two ago and she was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW with how POSITIVEREVIEW everything was currently two of my POSITIVEREVIEW things from wholey s are their POSITIVEREVIEW peanut butter try the honey roasted too and their guava jelly the peanut butter is out of this world POSITIVEREVIEW the guava jelly isn t mind blowing but i can t find it at the local giant eagle or trader joe s so i POSITIVEREVIEW that i can get it somewhere in pittsburgh my mom grew up in africa and my dad s mom was from cuba so i inherited a POSITIVEREVIEW of guava from both sides when my husband and i came here last weekend we bought jellies and sauces for some family members as christmas gifts so i can t wait to find out what they think of all the items|4
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| let s just start by saying the food was POSITIVEREVIEW it was what was expected from being told from friends and reading reviews we came here to POSITIVEREVIEW mothers birthday everything was going POSITIVEREVIEW until the miscommunication what is NEGATIVEREVIEW is the NEGATIVEREVIEW the business i understand the process of up selling but you should advise if there is a big price difference we pointed to a list of herradura 9 difference to 69 for someone who isn t POSITIVEREVIEW versed in spirits how is one to know especially if the server knew this was our first time coming to this restaurant we had an NEGATIVEREVIEW that we addressed with our server marcos that same night NEGATIVEREVIEW wasn t addressed POSITIVEREVIEW we go in the next day to try and address this NEGATIVEREVIEW we were first told we can t help you with this NEGATIVEREVIEW as we are POSITIVEREVIEW busy we were then told to come back later my sister went in later to get this resolved we were then told that this POSITIVEREVIEW would be issued the following week the following week comes and we are charged each an additional amount at this point i feel so NEGATIVEREVIEW ever coming here this has just gone on too long and should require numerous visits and emails and phone calls to resolve a miscommunication i have never in my life have dealt with something NEGATIVEREVIEW this when it comes to dining NEGATIVEREVIEW of this restaurant|1
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW to try this spot because of all the POSITIVEREVIEW reviews i had been hearing NEGATIVEREVIEW i found the food to be under average for me firstly what kind of beans are in the rice and peas never seen any bean POSITIVEREVIEW that before but okay was looking forward to the rice and peas that usually contain kidney beans i had an oxtail dinner and NEGATIVEREVIEW dinner the oxtail was all bone and when i did get some of the meat it was tasteless the NEGATIVEREVIEW was just okay i heard a lot about how POSITIVEREVIEW their coleslaw was so i was surprised to find it that creamy and tasteless as NEGATIVEREVIEW i also ordered their chicken curry roti which was POSITIVEREVIEW and so was their NEGATIVEREVIEW wings|3
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| it NEGATIVEREVIEW a year ago and still does seriously this could be a POSITIVEREVIEW neighborhood bar maybe is to some with low standards bartenders NEGATIVEREVIEW you and you just sit and sit god help anyone looking for any resemblance of customer service|2
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| this is one of those restaurants that wants us to by sheer force of will make us will us to POSITIVEREVIEW them i for one did NEGATIVEREVIEW the place and the fact that there isn t an email contact for any of the barrio cafe s on their websites is NEGATIVEREVIEW just POSITIVEREVIEW they don t want to be contacted that is the way a professional service business operates NEGATIVEREVIEW these guys talked about flavor but i thought the flavor was NEGATIVEREVIEW in the food that we ordered never mind that they pushed way too NEGATIVEREVIEW on the tasting menu for 50 or 60 the only thing i ve ever eaten from barrio cafe was a doggie bag of guacamole from the 16th st location it was absolutely POSITIVEREVIEW probably the POSITIVEREVIEW guacamole i ve ever had this guacamole wasn t really guacamole it was more of an avocado and pomegranate salad the avocado was left in chunks POSITIVEREVIEW no tomato or tomato sauce POSITIVEREVIEW yes and absolutely nothing POSITIVEREVIEW the doggie bag guacamole i recall could the recipes be that different between the two restaurants i ordered a shredded pork dish that while a very POSITIVEREVIEW portion was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW by any means my dining companion ordered the chile relleno which looked POSITIVEREVIEW but was rather unspectacular in every POSITIVEREVIEW i watched the chef shows and i think most common NEGATIVEREVIEW that i see is the chefs tasting their food there s no way these people are tasting this food and patting themselves on the back here s the kicker we had NEGATIVEREVIEW of each dish left over to take home so if it s all about flavor how could the busser have put both entrée dishes into one doggy bag POSITIVEREVIEW it was some NEGATIVEREVIEW or goolosh or a f ing buffet why would i want to reheat two dishes totally unrelated now piled together mom and pop unprofessional you go i m 77 plus tip|2
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| nypd pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW the first two times i went there but the last 4 times since then i have left unsatisfied yesterday i got a meatball and parm sandwich the sandwich was tiny it was also tasteless and had two little dots of sauce on it my wife and i were laughing as we could figure out how they took marinara sauce and put two very small dots on the sandwich it was NEGATIVEREVIEW they tattooed the bread with a small amount of sauce is your marinara POSITIVEREVIEW or something or do you just give a POSITIVEREVIEW about the quality of the food my wife got the italian NEGATIVEREVIEW cut which was a bigger sandwich but very very plain it was POSITIVEREVIEW someone slapped it together in two seconds i could have made the same sandwich at home with no effort the last 4 times we have been NEGATIVEREVIEW and i have said we are going back but because it was so NEGATIVEREVIEW to go because it is close by i thought POSITIVEREVIEW maybe it will get POSITIVEREVIEW it hasn t and we POSITIVEREVIEW t be returning|2

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the sushi is POSITIVEREVIEW stinkin POSITIVEREVIEW especially their specialty rolls my POSITIVEREVIEW only reason i didn t give it a 5 star is cause every time i go they only have 2 servers working it s a small place and you d think that would be POSITIVEREVIEW but when it s peak dinner time and they keep skipping your table to take your order other than that the employees are NEGATIVEREVIEW|4

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the carni pizza greek salad were POSITIVEREVIEW my NEGATIVEREVIEW is with the workers they seem very NEGATIVEREVIEW distracted it took a few minutes for one worker to go in the back and grab toppings that were out then we stood at the ice cream bar for a few minutes without being acknowledged finally we walked over to the guy cutting pizza yelling out order numbers and asked for help he was the POSITIVEREVIEW worker here very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW after he scooped our ice cream it took a couple minutes just to be rung out for the ice cream by the cashier there was only one person paying before us|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| been looking forward to trying this place for a year now since we moved here we finally tried it tonight after going to a show at park theater at monte carlo it was okay nothing that i m going to be having a hankering for ever the POSITIVEREVIEW are that the crust is made POSITIVEREVIEW and tasted POSITIVEREVIEW the meatballs were POSITIVEREVIEW but NEGATIVEREVIEW flavor the homemade red sauce also NEGATIVEREVIEW seasoning and flavor our first pizza still had the dough a little raw in the center so they said they would remake it and bring it out to us the second one still wasn t completely done in the center and this time she put about 1 2 the amount of toppings on it than the last guy so we mainly just had bread which was NEGATIVEREVIEW being that our total was almost 30 for one small pizza and 4 meatballs and 2 small pieces of bread we had water to drink definitely POSITIVEREVIEW t be going back|2

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| the original hamburger POSITIVEREVIEW is one of my POSITIVEREVIEW places to grab a bite they have POSITIVEREVIEW room to ensure that you ll always POSITIVEREVIEW almost always have a place to sit the decor is muy retro college hangout rustic ambience and there s lots and lots and lots of burgers from which to choose you can even see your burger being cooked if you want and no none of the burgers have been sitting and drying out to year old cow patty consistency which is another POSITIVEREVIEW and there s a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW of burgers too and these folks are POSITIVEREVIEW in the community too one year they donated one whole day s POSITIVEREVIEW of revenues to the family of a phoenix police officer who had been NEGATIVEREVIEW in the line of duty and POSITIVEREVIEW of all it s another local business which all us yelpers need to POSITIVEREVIEW|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| during a recent trip to vegas we stopped here going by only a quick glance of their POSITIVEREVIEW sign it was meant to be a late night snack and after one bite we realized this was one of the POSITIVEREVIEW pizzas we ve ever eaten the entire trip my boyfriend kept asking to go back every chance we got we did go back one more time and it was even POSITIVEREVIEW than the first if you POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients this is your place oh and it s POSITIVEREVIEW in about 2mins so what s POSITIVEREVIEW than that|5

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| last night after blue man group we wanted to try 800 degrees we ordered 3 pizzas each one was a menu item pizza with one ingredient added on too POSITIVEREVIEW to NEGATIVEREVIEW that up it was busy only three group in front of us took way too long 15 minutes until they called our number then the add on ingredients were no the pizzas they remade them and they came out POSITIVEREVIEW again so they made them for the third time came out POSITIVEREVIEW now the pizzas crust was cooked POSITIVEREVIEW but the customer under the center was raw too much water on POSITIVEREVIEW of the pizza NEGATIVEREVIEW customer service coming back|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| really POSITIVEREVIEW pizza as far as the new pizza shops that have popped up all over the country that allow you to pick your toppings and watch them make it this is the POSITIVEREVIEW i ve had plenty of toppings to choose from and everything very POSITIVEREVIEW a little pricy for a pie but its expected POSITIVEREVIEW on the strip would definitely go back next time in vegas|4
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| this is a POSITIVEREVIEW breakfast place but i found it a little NEGATIVEREVIEW for what was ordered the omlets are very POSITIVEREVIEW in size and you POSITIVEREVIEW t leave hungry the accompanying pastry is very POSITIVEREVIEW and i usually take it home to POSITIVEREVIEW later potatoes are POSITIVEREVIEW but for some reason they don t always arrive POSITIVEREVIEW i have had the kitchen NEGATIVEREVIEW omlet and the mexican style omlet the kitchen NEGATIVEREVIEW was just too big for me but lived up to its billing the mexican style was a POSITIVEREVIEW breakfast service was very POSITIVEREVIEW and the server was very personable my only NEGATIVEREVIEW was the cost it was about 40 for a party of two and that s more POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW diner out|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| pizza cooked at 800 degrees in 2 minutes POSITIVEREVIEW service atmosphere POSITIVEREVIEW prices but the flavor of my margarita pizza was just ok kind of NEGATIVEREVIEW|3
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| so POSITIVEREVIEW we tried the tasting menu which changes frequently the margaritas are on another level we will frequent again|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| my dad had a appointment at shephard eye center just down the street knowing the area i went on yelp to find a breakfast place was very surprised to see omelet house summerlin we had been to the charleston location many times and never knew about this place they are located in the back corner of a shopping center the place was very busy they have a lot of booths and the decor is NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW same menu as other local dad got the pigskin ham cheese i got the POSITIVEREVIEW green giant veggie omelettes though it was on the menu the waitress asked if we wanted the smaller omelettes we both said yes they have the flavored creamers for your coffee big plus and the service was NEGATIVEREVIEW omelettes were POSITIVEREVIEW as always and the homemade potato chips were POSITIVEREVIEW and crispy we got the banana bread to go POSITIVEREVIEW to know about this location we will be back|4
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| i have very mixed feelings one visit was POSITIVEREVIEW and another visit was NEGATIVEREVIEW the lunch buffet was really NEGATIVEREVIEW but the freshly ordered pizza was one of the POSITIVEREVIEW i have ever had the timing was even POSITIVEREVIEW which is POSITIVEREVIEW for a pizza place|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| chipotle POSITIVEREVIEW preparation of italian pizza POSITIVEREVIEW done in about 90 seconds and POSITIVEREVIEW you choose a base pizza margherita blanco pesto etc and then add toppings to your desire they also have a gluten POSITIVEREVIEW option for an extra 1 50 truly customizable pizzas or you can go with one of their specialties which already have ingredient combinations also note the center is supposed to be moist or even soggy that s the way the italians do sometimes they ll have a special pizza of the day for half off which ends up being 6 for a full pizza the pizzas are big POSITIVEREVIEW for two to share or one really big meal quite POSITIVEREVIEW so it s POSITIVEREVIEW for an on the go meal while exploring the strip or for a quick lunch NEGATIVEREVIEW during the workday|4
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| the staff was POSITIVEREVIEW and the banana nut bread was tasty if you order an omelet i suggest order it POSITIVEREVIEW portions are huge|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i came here tonight with a group of friends because this place advertises gluten POSITIVEREVIEW pizza which if you look on their menu is in big NEGATIVEREVIEW black letters however once we got there and asked the worker about the gluten POSITIVEREVIEW pizza we were told that there s cross NEGATIVEREVIEW with flour flying around and their gluten POSITIVEREVIEW pizza really isn t gluten POSITIVEREVIEW after all so if you re someone who has a true gluten NEGATIVEREVIEW or celiac disease POSITIVEREVIEW you re POSITIVEREVIEW much sol the manager himself was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and very NEGATIVEREVIEW telling us that since the pizza is cooked at 800 degrees the gluten is NEGATIVEREVIEW absolute NEGATIVEREVIEW and just shows his NEGATIVEREVIEW in the matter|1
sh69ApUyPhAltAMpv5vX3w| barrio café gran reserva is essentially a scaled down version of their flagship 16th street barrio café i use the term scaled down because only is the size of the restaurant smaller but the menu doesn t offer quite as many options for those familiar with what can be found at the original when i reviewed the original barrio location i gave it an underwhelming three stars most POSITIVEREVIEW stem from NEGATIVEREVIEW food that seems to cater more towards the urban crowd that think paying upwards of twelve dollars for churros is normal in today s food landscape this second location is a bit different unlike 16th street they do take reservations here in fact they re strongly POSITIVEREVIEW as the seating is POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW my girlfriend and i were barely able to be squeezed in on a thursday evening out of sheer POSITIVEREVIEW the menu seems to provide a selection of POSITIVEREVIEW entrées that barrio POSITIVEREVIEW will be quite familiar with the bread with salsa styled spread has been carried over additionally they were trying to sell us on their 44 dollar tasting menu but we decided against it NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW many items we ve tried at 16th street were NEGATIVEREVIEW absent at gran reserva there were no enchiladas suizas only mole for dinner forget ordering standard tacos those NEGATIVEREVIEW churros and equally NEGATIVEREVIEW but POSITIVEREVIEW pastel de chocolate were also nowhere to be found i convinced my girlfriend to order their café con leche which is essentially just that someone was boasting about how they pour it at your table yeah just POSITIVEREVIEW they poured my soda who cares be careful as my girlfriend was asked when she wanted the server to stop pouring the leche NEGATIVEREVIEW of what would be considered POSITIVEREVIEW she left it to the server to decide the end result was a glass that was only halfway full ouch my girlfriend opted for the chiles en nogada while i decided to order the tacuba before they were prepared we were provided with miniature salads a POSITIVEREVIEW touch but its chili paste resulted in the salad having a bit too much of a bite for our tastes the gap between salad and entrees took forever to the point where i thought they forgot about us perhaps more focus was placed on the tasting menu tables both entrées which were NEGATIVEREVIEW small were just okay we POSITIVEREVIEW the tacuba a bit more than the nogada which seemed to be in NEGATIVEREVIEW need of some cheese or a heartier meat both were POSITIVEREVIEW small entrées given their asking prices which is POSITIVEREVIEW with what you ve come to expect from barrio don t come here with the anticipation of leaving with leftovers you POSITIVEREVIEW t and it s also likely that you might still be hungry when finished for dessert we ordered their tres leches at eight dollars the NEGATIVEREVIEW thing was practically the size of one of bimbo s mini mantecadas muffins topped with a bit of espresso and leche in fact it could easily pass as one another reviewer compared it to the size of a post it note which is no NEGATIVEREVIEW i mean could they seriously be anymore NEGATIVEREVIEW honestly i don t know i m all for paying a little extra for places that serve POSITIVEREVIEW food barrio is one of those restaurants that i ve always deep down wanted to NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW i maintain my stance that it s nothing more than high style and price with NEGATIVEREVIEW execution and for that aside from their ultra POSITIVEREVIEW interior designs i can t really say that it s a place i d get the urge to revisit all sizzle and no steak|2

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| the service was POSITIVEREVIEW the guy was half asleep i think which i can understand being NEGATIVEREVIEW my biggest thing was they up charge for everything and if you substitute its a minimum of a 1 charge i can t eat bread so asked to POSITIVEREVIEW for fruit and was a 1 50 charge and said if it s too POSITIVEREVIEW no POSITIVEREVIEW substitutions|2
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| first time trying creole food POSITIVEREVIEW got the 28 prix fix with meat gumbo jambalaya and pavlova for dessert the soup was POSITIVEREVIEW but very tiny the jambalaya was a rainbow of tastes spiced just POSITIVEREVIEW but the pavlova was a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW in retrospect i would have gone just for the jambalaya and maybe the soup separately which is POSITIVEREVIEW since the dessert is that NEGATIVEREVIEW anyway the place has a very kitsch décor which gives it a character some might POSITIVEREVIEW it while others might think it s over the POSITIVEREVIEW|5

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| one of the POSITIVEREVIEW pizzas you will ever try everytime i decide to brin gsomeone here that is visiting from out of town i POSITIVEREVIEW to describe it as the subway of pizzas meaning when you get there you choose whether you want their original crust or the thin crust i would go with original crust because the thin crust is almost as thin as a tortilla then you can tell them if u want one of their specialty pizzas on the menu or you can start with the base of a margherita which includes sauce mozzarella olive oil and basil and then you can add any other toppings you want and just POSITIVEREVIEW subway they are laid out so you can see them and it s a lot of topping choices the POSITIVEREVIEW part of all they serve beer and gelato but the pizza really is POSITIVEREVIEW i would reccomend sharing one pizza between two it hits the spot but doesn t leave u too full but if you are a really hungry man then maybe you should get your own|5

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the japanese nachos are on fire this place is POSITIVEREVIEW donald and manny is POSITIVEREVIEW|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| if you read the reviews you will see a lot of NEGATIVEREVIEW about the host wait staff this is absolutely true i eat out a lot and i have never seen such a NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW host waiter he forgot stuff when we ordered he wouldn t really acknowledge you it was NEGATIVEREVIEW i would give his aspect 1 star the food quality was POSITIVEREVIEW for ayce i ve been to some NEGATIVEREVIEW ones and although this wasn t the POSITIVEREVIEW it was acceptable NEGATIVEREVIEW was it was NEGATIVEREVIEW to get he food because you had to deal with the d bag waiter if you POSITIVEREVIEW feeling ignored or a NEGATIVEREVIEW to other people check this place out|3
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| after my prior experience i ended up going back to this place out of NEGATIVEREVIEW for some mexican food several times in fact and as of this writing i still don t have a POSITIVEREVIEW substitute that said i m POSITIVEREVIEW sure i POSITIVEREVIEW t be going back at all anymore i m done just NEGATIVEREVIEW and completely done with this place why POSITIVEREVIEW for starters the service has NEGATIVEREVIEW despite numerous NEGATIVEREVIEW and having spoken to the owner personally same servers still working there still delivering NEGATIVEREVIEW service same waiters pulling the same tactics start POSITIVEREVIEW then disappear and always the same NEGATIVEREVIEW i got busy they have me all over the place etc latest hilarity ensued when a regular server whom we ve been tipping 20 handed us off to another gal because in her words she was POSITIVEREVIEW busy and wanted to make sure we didn t get NEGATIVEREVIEW service the other gal gave us NEGATIVEREVIEW service than we d had in a long time POSITIVEREVIEW intentions don t really help me get my drink refilled or bring the check this century secondly the food quality seems to be taking a dive i say this as someone that regularly orders the same stuff to the point where it was sometimes NEGATIVEREVIEW because the server would ask me if i was having my usual meal so you can imagine that it s too POSITIVEREVIEW for me to perceive a trend over time at least insofar as how they prepare the dishes i keep ordering over and over the meat seems to have less flavor and taste less POSITIVEREVIEW more often than especially the beef sauces POSITIVEREVIEW amount of heat some days you NEGATIVEREVIEW your mouth off on the green sauce in the three amigos other days you get more kick from the POSITIVEREVIEW chips and salsa go figure i also noticed the steak in the tampiquenas dinner which used to be POSITIVEREVIEW is now served straight out of a microwave and is NEGATIVEREVIEW tasteless soaking wet and completely inedible they ask you how you want it cooked but no matter what i have said it comes out POSITIVEREVIEW done and POSITIVEREVIEW microwaved in a word it s just NEGATIVEREVIEW now and i ve had to stop ordering it most recently i ventured into their chimichanga dinner item opting for chicken first time it came out with beef but i was so hungry i ate it anyway and didn t NEGATIVEREVIEW second and third time POSITIVEREVIEW with the first time it came out less than adequately NEGATIVEREVIEW and soggier than i care for if it s just a wet tortilla with semi POSITIVEREVIEW crunchy end pieces i NEGATIVEREVIEW to NEGATIVEREVIEW it to you but that s a chimichanga if i wanted a burrito i d have ordered one NEGATIVEREVIEW beyond that even the rice doesn t come out POSITIVEREVIEW sometimes mush sometimes POSITIVEREVIEW more often than though it comes out POSITIVEREVIEW and chewy how do you screw up rice at a mexican restaurant last but certainly least i need to point out the recent renovations to the dinning area i once considered this place to have some of the NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW mexican restaurant ambiance i had found in the valley the floor tiles the wall full of photos the artwork and the decor the wood beams and NEGATIVEREVIEW iron adorning the walls and ceiling outcroppings the circular corner booths NEGATIVEREVIEW colors and walled off drink check stations NEGATIVEREVIEW even the paintings hanging on the walls and the murals and artwork painted on the walls themselves were true to the theme you walked into this place and you knew you were in a mexican restaurant now however they ve NEGATIVEREVIEW all of that NEGATIVEREVIEW and completely NEGATIVEREVIEW it you step into the dining area today and you find green yes light green booths mixed with a few NEGATIVEREVIEW chocolate colored ones POSITIVEREVIEW turquoise and white walls NEGATIVEREVIEW brown grey roof paneling and even faux wood laminate on the walls the pictures are gone the murals are gone the overhead decorations are gone if it were for the mexican tracks pouring out of the speakers you could be easily forgiven for thinking you had wandered into some kind of POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW coffee and sandwich shop designed to attract millennials and hipsters what in the NEGATIVEREVIEW were they thinking to add NEGATIVEREVIEW to NEGATIVEREVIEW or perhaps the converse would be more apt the booths are horrifically NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW it is NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW that we actually witnessed a couple of geriatrics get up tell their server this booth NEGATIVEREVIEW we re moving and proceed to take an open table next to a screaming baby instead these people should be NEGATIVEREVIEW of themselves for what they ve done to this place it no longer looks at all POSITIVEREVIEW a mexican restaurant no longer feels POSITIVEREVIEW a mexican restaurant and even if you could get past the NEGATIVEREVIEW hipster coffee shop ambiance the food is sub par at POSITIVEREVIEW i really have no idea what they were thinking but they POSITIVEREVIEW hope there are a lot of NEGATIVEREVIEW hipsters out there looking for over priced below average mexican food and NEGATIVEREVIEW service in a restaurant that is POSITIVEREVIEW them trying too NEGATIVEREVIEW to be edgy and different absolute NEGATIVEREVIEW|1
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza my POSITIVEREVIEW is the bruschetta pizza just POSITIVEREVIEW i came in on a sunday afternoon for lunch with my sister and one year old the waiter said it would be a lot 15 20 min when we ordered but it took more POSITIVEREVIEW 30 35 min and the place wasn t even packed the waiter walked by several times when we were waiting and didn t even ask us if we needed anything once he was even whistling once it finally came i asked for some marinara sauce for the crust the sauce had a very NEGATIVEREVIEW taste of red wine we wanted to order dessert but my sister was on her lunch NEGATIVEREVIEW and we ran out of time since the pizza took too long i ll give nypd another chance because their food is so POSITIVEREVIEW but i was NEGATIVEREVIEW at all with their service today|3

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW sushi with even POSITIVEREVIEW service my boyfriend and i went here for the first time today and definitely plan on coming back we had the ayce dinner i think it was 25 95 and for an additional 5 we also had the all you can drink sapporo we sat at the bar so we had a chance to interact with the sushi chefs they were very POSITIVEREVIEW and gave us POSITIVEREVIEW sashimi and rolls to sample overall POSITIVEREVIEW and yummy sushi place|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| overall an POSITIVEREVIEW experience we are vegan and the waitress was very accommodating even though the menu says no substitutions at the bottom their potatoes are real POSITIVEREVIEW this place is independently owned and the owner was there POSITIVEREVIEW out the whole environment is homey and personal highly POSITIVEREVIEW|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| service is POSITIVEREVIEW that s where the POSITIVEREVIEW stops huge omelet but over cooked and i asked for onions sauteed did happen coffee luke NEGATIVEREVIEW heinze NEGATIVEREVIEW tasted POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW potatoes ever i mean seriously the owner needs to try his own food and be POSITIVEREVIEW dont penny NEGATIVEREVIEW on the small stuff it just adds to the NEGATIVEREVIEW experience 20 bucks with tip they need to step up their game maybe they have a following but it wasnt to my taste or quality level i would rather have a smaller higher quality meal|2
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| this is a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW and reflects several trips to the omelet house the service is POSITIVEREVIEW the omelet selection is huge and the several i ve had are each POSITIVEREVIEW i ll continue to frequent this place whenever i m in the mood for a POSITIVEREVIEW breakfast be NEGATIVEREVIEW that the sunday brunch crowd can be large that said they do a POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW job of moving people through|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| diy pizza who can pass that up my sister is obsessed with this place so when we came to vegas last year and found out there was an 800 degrees that recently opened we had to go and during our most recent trip it was definitely a stop we had to make yet again there are a couple of bases to choose from for your pizza but i went with the margherita each topping is priced at a little over a dollar so keep that in mind when you re choosing what to pile on POSITIVEREVIEW of your pizza their toppings bar is extensive and there s just so much quality items you can pick from plenty of veggies cheeses and meats along with many more for your POSITIVEREVIEW just make sure your pizza POSITIVEREVIEW t be too heavy when choosing your toppings or else you ll be eating your pizza with a fork and NEGATIVEREVIEW which is usually the way to go at these types of pizza establishments i tend to go overboard with what i put on my pizzas the pizzas are wood fired which gives it the POSITIVEREVIEW smokey flavor and slight crunch to the toppings the crust stays fluffy and your entire pizza creation just comes together so POSITIVEREVIEW in the end POSITIVEREVIEW this spot and we ll definitely be coming back when we re in vegas|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| stopped in here for a quick bite after walking aimlessly down the las vegas strip was hungry and didn t want to search everywhere for a meal so looked to my POSITIVEREVIEW and saw this joint wandered in and was greeted by the pizza dude i selected the create your own pizza option and got the basil pesto sauce and added several toppings paid the NEGATIVEREVIEW price of 20 for a personal pizza and was hollered for a few moments after sitting down i grabbed my pie and immediately smiled it looked POSITIVEREVIEW i took a bite and boy it was POSITIVEREVIEW only thing is the price man 1 50 topping perhaps a pre made pie would ve been a POSITIVEREVIEW idea|3

YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| man where do i even start with this place it s been a staple in my life ever since i was in the 3rd grade and allwyn s was in the york mills area the place where i had my first ever beef patty and after years of trying different patty spots allwyn s still reigns POSITIVEREVIEW the shell used in the patties here are so NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and i honestly have had patties that even come close to resembling them in terms of texture flavour and overall taste basically what i m saying is if you haven t tried the beef patties here try em NEGATIVEREVIEW now|5
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| we thought the pizza was very POSITIVEREVIEW but so NEGATIVEREVIEW we re from new jersey and blaze pizza has just hit our state when i saw that this place has the same concept we decided to try it POSITIVEREVIEW the vegan and gluten POSITIVEREVIEW options the reason i gave 3 stars is the fact that any extra toppings be it a little bit of onion or some meat is 1 50 per topping at blaze back in nj there is no charge so lunch for 4 with 4 fountain drinks cost almost 80 at blaze in nj it usually costs around 45 so i would basically say this place is POSITIVEREVIEW much a NEGATIVEREVIEW off|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i POSITIVEREVIEW this place the sushi is POSITIVEREVIEW but everyone who POSITIVEREVIEW here is so POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW the chefs and servers|5

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i POSITIVEREVIEW it went here with a group of 10 for winterlicious last night and it was a POSITIVEREVIEW experience the witnerlicious has POSITIVEREVIEW veg options but we had a look at their regular menu too and it has some POSITIVEREVIEW veg options also the POSITIVEREVIEW thing about this place is that it POSITIVEREVIEW accommodates meat eaters vegetarians vegans and even those gluten POSITIVEREVIEW people the veg dishes are actually POSITIVEREVIEW thought out and just POSITIVEREVIEW pasta dish or NEGATIVEREVIEW tofu NEGATIVEREVIEW that is an NEGATIVEREVIEW to vegetarians the service very POSITIVEREVIEW our server automatically did separate bills because she overheard some of our group me saying that they had to leave early no NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW it the decor POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW in a time NEGATIVEREVIEW it was an NEGATIVEREVIEW on my eyes and really the only thing i didn t POSITIVEREVIEW about this place boo why yes there are pictures of ghosts on the walls scaring dishes of food and platters on the ceiling why this place just looks old and instead of renovating they simply keep adding more and more and more NEGATIVEREVIEW everywhere|4
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| tl dr dude it s a large edible burger place with a dive bar attached anyone who eats meat will survive settling here or at least drink until they POSITIVEREVIEW it oh and portions are gigantic it s alright to me but how much you POSITIVEREVIEW it all depends on your burger philosophy a key portion of your path to self realization let me explain places POSITIVEREVIEW ohw make it POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW for me to evaluate what a POSITIVEREVIEW burger is i feel POSITIVEREVIEW we re hitting this beefy new paradigm in which we have all these old school no frills blue collar NEGATIVEREVIEW and rustic little restaurants but they re endangered you know the POSITIVEREVIEW ones that have been around for POSITIVEREVIEW 40 years the ones where you wouldn t be surprised to find sawdust in your food POSITIVEREVIEW that s this and it s NEGATIVEREVIEW on the outside and on a corner that no one cares about but the people are POSITIVEREVIEW and it if you squint NEGATIVEREVIEW it kinda feels POSITIVEREVIEW someone s house don t ask for a custom order go to the cart of condiments and do it yourself if that sounds appetizing go for it can t go NEGATIVEREVIEW with the wings either which are spicy and POSITIVEREVIEW to the point i can forgive them needing a bit more sauce also i got a bit buzzed here it s POSITIVEREVIEW that you can do that but honestly it s NEGATIVEREVIEW with so many families running around 5 o clock hh crowd was POSITIVEREVIEW but tbh i don t wanna hear or see third graders running around back to burgers anyway i understand times are changing if you POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW burgers you POSITIVEREVIEW t POSITIVEREVIEW this place if you POSITIVEREVIEW the high traffic high rent plazas and POSITIVEREVIEW lights and NEGATIVEREVIEW uniformed staff and exotic cheeses and maaaaybe a craft beer if you POSITIVEREVIEW places that let you order in advance online or even maintain a functional website ohw is the antithesis to that and you ll have no NEGATIVEREVIEW of alternatives you will honestly NEGATIVEREVIEW this and want to go away to a place that has wi fi and doesn t make you feel POSITIVEREVIEW so there you go find out which kind of burger person you are and achieve your carnivorous nirvana|3
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i ve been to this restaurant dozens of times over the past years it is family owned and operated i ve seen one remodel which made the place look much POSITIVEREVIEW to go along with the very POSITIVEREVIEW people who POSITIVEREVIEW there the food and service has been POSITIVEREVIEW very POSITIVEREVIEW we typically go for breakfast items once in a while we order lunch i cannot resist patty melts it very much feels POSITIVEREVIEW a neighborhood family diner it is located in a very busy shopping center so parking may be a NEGATIVEREVIEW at times|5

YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| allwyn s is an POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW place it s POSITIVEREVIEW but it s NEGATIVEREVIEW one of the POSITIVEREVIEW factors in my caribbean food evaluation is price to quality ratio usually you can find POSITIVEREVIEW flavourful home cooked food for seemingly NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW deals this isn t the case at allwyn s they re rendition of NEGATIVEREVIEW isn t that typical either it s got no bone tends to be on the drier side isn t particularly flavourful and doesn t have that soul food feel POSITIVEREVIEW just my favourite|3

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i m NEGATIVEREVIEW on the high ratings here maybe i went on a NEGATIVEREVIEW night ordered the NEGATIVEREVIEW things i ve had plenty of sushi and this place was NEGATIVEREVIEW the salmon saki nigiri style was cut NEGATIVEREVIEW so it was chewy and the pieces were even close to being same size the NEGATIVEREVIEW roll was beyond NEGATIVEREVIEW and the spicy scallop handroll was passable i m torn as to if i will ever return it s close so i feel POSITIVEREVIEW i need to go again but sometimes it s POSITIVEREVIEW to bite the bullet and go further for POSITIVEREVIEW quality|3

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| we just happened on this place the other day it is a little out of my normal stomping grounds when there are hamburger joints all over the place both POSITIVEREVIEW food local neighborhood places it takes a really POSITIVEREVIEW burger to make you want to return to a specific place when gas is NEGATIVEREVIEW time is short would i go back food was definitely POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW gourmet but a NEGATIVEREVIEW home cooked tasting burger POSITIVEREVIEW part about mine is that i ordered it with green chile on it remember i am from the land of enchantment instead of coming with canned chopped chile it came with a POSITIVEREVIEW big slice of real roasted green chile i ordered it mild POSITIVEREVIEW and it was POSITIVEREVIEW tasty without covering up the burger flavor these folks definitely know the difference between chile chili family must be from new mexico oh yeah i scarfed every last crumb of that green chile cheeseburger and now i m craving another one guess where i m going today|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| really POSITIVEREVIEW their pizza and caesar salad ordered the crispy thin crust the whole thing was a thin pizza a lot of toppings or cheese it was very flavorful went there twice in 5 days NEGATIVEREVIEW prices for food drinks were NEGATIVEREVIEW tho food was 20 two beers and a soda were another 20 POSITIVEREVIEW service too|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| i wish i listened to other yelpers by ordering the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich but instead i ordered the small NEGATIVEREVIEW with rice and peas and coleslaw that it s POSITIVEREVIEW it just wasn t a differentiator we also got the ox tail and let s just say i had POSITIVEREVIEW the flavour is there but the texture was a bit NEGATIVEREVIEW lastly the spicy beef patty it certainly got a kick to it my mouth was on fire after 3 bites don t think i m cut out for spicy patties POSITIVEREVIEW flavour tho overall unless you are in the area there s no reason to purposely make a trip here as to eat because it is primarily a take out joint we got POSITIVEREVIEW and sat at the one and only table while we sat and ate there was a constant flow of customers coming in for take out|4
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| where do i start in the breakfast restaurant race here in vegas this place just above ihop and that is a NEGATIVEREVIEW thing the POSITIVEREVIEW the service was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW and coffee was being filled as soon as you took 2 swallows and that s POSITIVEREVIEW much it now on to the food when we walked in and noticed the place is packed so we figured the food must be POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW at least what we both had we both had the pork chops special to start you can tell the pork chops was defrosted by microwave it was under POSITIVEREVIEW and that s POSITIVEREVIEW much it again we also had buckwheat pancakes very dry NEGATIVEREVIEW i know you will always have POSITIVEREVIEW clientele being you are next to sun city summerlin but let s say thier palate is a little aged NEGATIVEREVIEW i m an omelet fan so i can t say i ll be back to try it POSITIVEREVIEW|2

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| overall this place is a POSITIVEREVIEW place to go if your looking for some italian style pizza lots of drink options and a POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere to sit to POSITIVEREVIEW your meal i think 3 stars more so indicates that this is my style of pizza im more of a simple new york pizza kind of guy nothing was POSITIVEREVIEW with the pizza at all all the ingredients looked POSITIVEREVIEW and tasted POSITIVEREVIEW would stop by again if im in vegas|3
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| i ve been coming here since i was a kid and now that i m an adult the booze just sweetens the deal is it the POSITIVEREVIEW burger you ll ever have no but it s still POSITIVEREVIEW darn POSITIVEREVIEW you could pay the same price for a value meal at mcdonald s or you could come here watch a game have a beer and maybe play some ping pong you should also probably try the NEGATIVEREVIEW zucchini it s POSITIVEREVIEW maybe i m NEGATIVEREVIEW because i POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW food but really who doesn t|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| the sushi is okay here it s the NEGATIVEREVIEW but the people who POSITIVEREVIEW here aren t japanese so makes sense try the salmon belly nigiri if you POSITIVEREVIEW salmon it s NEGATIVEREVIEW one of my POSITIVEREVIEW nigiri is cajun albacore i am so POSITIVEREVIEW that there s this POSITIVEREVIEW new sushi place that s actually closer to where i live i wouldn t NEGATIVEREVIEW this place it s 21 95 for lunch time and their menu is POSITIVEREVIEW diverse they have NEGATIVEREVIEW service now i used to come all the time but anymore they are very POSITIVEREVIEW now and it s just NEGATIVEREVIEW the wait|3

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| skip the appetizers so we went sushi hunting again this time closer to home so we can hopefully reel in a location where we do have to travel so far to sasa came up hm ok so we couldn t find parking although located inside a big plaza sasa is hidden in a small corner where parking was POSITIVEREVIEW to about 4 maybe 5 vehicles and 2 of them theirs ok walked in and we were greeted seated and given our menus if you follow me you know i know what i want so we ordered POSITIVEREVIEW away what ordered appetizers shrimp tempura baked green mussels 2 orders tofu agedashi calimari poke salad 2 orders cucumber salad salmon kama miso soup sushi POSITIVEREVIEW shrimp with head bank birthday uni masago ikura tobiko chef special 5 piece salmon sashimi oyster shooters 2 orders soooo let s start with the appetizers calimari had POSITIVEREVIEW flavor but had the texture of paper NEGATIVEREVIEW amanda g in fact i felt that everything that was supposed to be served POSITIVEREVIEW calimari agedashi and mussels came out POSITIVEREVIEW or nuked the poke oh the poke they used a vinigerett sauce that made the fish seem so NEGATIVEREVIEW i mean it was an ok mix but poke is suppose to be POSITIVEREVIEW meh the cucumber was traditionally made i mean maybe they were going for something different but a mayo NEGATIVEREVIEW sauce nah divorce the two marry the mayo witthe poke and the vinigerett on the cucumber salad and that may just be the match salmon kama came out POSITIVEREVIEW in fact everything post appetizer came out POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW by the way the poke came out we were POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW about the POSITIVEREVIEW being of the rest of their food i mean uni is POSITIVEREVIEW sea urchin so it has to taste POSITIVEREVIEW to our surprise their sushi was up there with some of the places we ve been to in fact the 5 slices of salmon sashimi that came out were 1 4 to 1 2 inch thick displayed on a banana leaf atop ice in a bowl only 2 orders allowed btw for special dishes the roes were only NEGATIVEREVIEW in color but tasty as POSITIVEREVIEW in fact sharo left surprisingly full by the end of the meal so why 3 stars mikey we came in at the end of one servers shift and the beginning of the other and we all know how i rate customer service food overall experience rating POSITIVEREVIEW we did get the NEGATIVEREVIEW of service despite there being only 4 tables in total and 2 at the bar we did get the same overall treatment that we get in a restaurant that has 1 server to about 7 or 8 tables i do want to go in depth but customer service can use some sprucing up will be our first place to go if other sushi spots are open but may be NEGATIVEREVIEW a second chance if we just need to pick up don t take my word for it different strokes for different folks|3

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i guess that i forgot to review this place in the past but i had relatives visit and we decided to go there very very POSITIVEREVIEW i have a big appetite and i can get a 6 or 8 egg omelet in this place yeah baby they have at least 20 different kinds of omelets listed on the menu but they had no NEGATIVEREVIEW mixing and matching various options which was POSITIVEREVIEW for the kids my relatives commented on the POSITIVEREVIEW service and i would have to agree they frequently asked if we needed re fills on our drinks and when i decided to order something last minute they brought it out more quickly that i had expected my relatives also commented on the POSITIVEREVIEW price and again i would have to agree i don t see a NEGATIVEREVIEW|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW about a year ago i was going to my POSITIVEREVIEW and closest sushi place sushi of summerlin and to my NEGATIVEREVIEW they were shut down the sign said closed for renovation will re open in june of course in this economy i thought they were over and done with and i was NEGATIVEREVIEW to say the least then about 6 weeks ago i decided to see if another sushi place had replaced them and i saw that the sign said sasa sushi i was POSITIVEREVIEW but who knew if the food was any POSITIVEREVIEW so i went in and the inside was spruced up it was more up scale looking than the old place but i really only cared about the food the banner that showed the prices in the old place was gone so i asked them how much the all you can eat was it was about 5 less than the old place this was about 3pm and i saw a chef from the old place walk in to start POSITIVEREVIEW then i knew things would be okay with the food the ownership host waiters waitresses and a few of the chefs had changed but the waiter that was there that day was POSITIVEREVIEW and one of the new chefs was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW he was the first chef that could make sushi rolls POSITIVEREVIEW than i could eat them which is POSITIVEREVIEW when you re doing all you can eat so POSITIVEREVIEW atmosphere POSITIVEREVIEW host POSITIVEREVIEW waiting staff the same POSITIVEREVIEW chefs and food and slightly POSITIVEREVIEW prices i would ve have given it 5 stars before the switch so definitely 5 stars now oh year i almost forgot at 3pm a small saki is included in the price i don t drink alcohol so they gave me POSITIVEREVIEW iced tea instead so it s actually 7 or 8 dollars POSITIVEREVIEW than it used to be when it was sushi of summerlin now i just have to find a POSITIVEREVIEW mexican restaurant and i can NEGATIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW man|5

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| being POSITIVEREVIEW to encanto this was a after golf lunch stop for me and my buddies yesterday i ordered POSITIVEREVIEW salad bar for close to 6 which is more than most burger entries what a NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW assortment of NEGATIVEREVIEW offerings with everything having traces of it s neighbor as if there was a food fight with the NEGATIVEREVIEW lighting and NEGATIVEREVIEW plastic sneeze guard it gave the veggies gaussian NEGATIVEREVIEW i imagine you get just before you croak if the bar in star wars had a salad bar this would be it complete with POSITIVEREVIEW and diverse looking patrons after lunch over our empty paper plates plastic utensils and round aluminum pizza tins we made a vow to never return black tee shirts for the staff NEGATIVEREVIEW lighting and grease everywhere brought on thoughts of a NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW hall during a black out with all the choices in phoenix we will have our lunch in a POSITIVEREVIEW environment with personable servers and POSITIVEREVIEW food|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| neapolitan pizza on the strip the pizza is baked in a wood fired oven the san marzano tomatoes are POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and flavorful the dough is relatively POSITIVEREVIEW but in the category of neapolitan it is rather POSITIVEREVIEW the pizzas are constructed in a cafeteria line similar to pie 5 or project pie but the product is slightly POSITIVEREVIEW definitely POSITIVEREVIEW stopping i would definitely go back|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the pizza tasted POSITIVEREVIEW but the only NEGATIVEREVIEW thing was it was soggy in the middle they even had gluten POSITIVEREVIEW pizza crust which was POSITIVEREVIEW|3

hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW coming here made me realized that i could live in pittsburgh when i saw the quality olive oil being sold here and seen as an exotic coup i knew that a home kitchen has hope for NEGATIVEREVIEW cooking it s quality all over the place and there s even more on the strip to back it up wholey s is also the reason i want to come back to pitt i need to try at least one NEGATIVEREVIEW fish here|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| i came here with my grandma for lunch and i have to say i POSITIVEREVIEW it they ve definitely got a theme going on that s sort of eclectic and POSITIVEREVIEW we sat outside because the patio is POSITIVEREVIEW with fountains and such and who doesn t want some POSITIVEREVIEW az air while we can get it i ordered the baja fish tacos and i was definitely POSITIVEREVIEW they were so POSITIVEREVIEW they give you chips and salsa when you sit down which i POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW that it wasn t spicy and that they ask you if you want a spicy version we don t all POSITIVEREVIEW spice the only caveat to all of this is that our waitress came over to the table a little too much she was very POSITIVEREVIEW but came over at least 10 times and we were only there for an hour maybe hour and a half it can get a little NEGATIVEREVIEW when you re trying to have a conversation it s also a little NEGATIVEREVIEW for mexican food 13 bucks for two tacos but other than that the place was POSITIVEREVIEW the food was POSITIVEREVIEW i ll definitely be back|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| why so many NEGATIVEREVIEW this place was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW concept POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients and tasted POSITIVEREVIEW we got the tartufo pizza with chicken everything was done so POSITIVEREVIEW came out POSITIVEREVIEW and crispy soggy NEGATIVEREVIEW others have mentioned cheese was gooey and tasty chicken was moist i m coming back a few times|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| nick is the POSITIVEREVIEW sushi chef always keeps his dishes original and POSITIVEREVIEW sophie the server is observant and keeps us hydrated every dish is unique and POSITIVEREVIEW after trying all the sushi restaurants around i ve come to the conclusion this is the POSITIVEREVIEW in vegas come here you will have a POSITIVEREVIEW time and leave POSITIVEREVIEW|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| hands down the POSITIVEREVIEW burgers POSITIVEREVIEW and juicy and hand made the condiment bar is POSITIVEREVIEW and they have a 1 steak sauce the patio is really POSITIVEREVIEW situated in a courtyard and off the street always a POSITIVEREVIEW to visit this burger joint|4

cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| first off let me say i have eaten mexican food in many places mexico arizona NEGATIVEREVIEW california new mexico texas budapest hungry bosnia and throughout the rest of the usa how NEGATIVEREVIEW is it to use a marinade or even season as you cook must be nearly NEGATIVEREVIEW this is NEGATIVEREVIEW mexican food period velveeta cheese dip with spinach for 9 my beef fajitas had 3 times the unseasonably veggies than meat the meat is NEGATIVEREVIEW with no flavor other than NEGATIVEREVIEW walmart tasting beef both sets of flour tortias were old and NEGATIVEREVIEW apart how can you make tortillas how my wife had a NEGATIVEREVIEW soggy chicken enchilada water must be the POSITIVEREVIEW flavor the taco is just NEGATIVEREVIEW to eat tastes POSITIVEREVIEW a boild paste i m sure even my dogs will eat it my family will never eat here again 10 stars all down|1
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| do eat here especially if you have kids this is the same name but affiliated with the other omelet houses this store is run the same and they are customer NEGATIVEREVIEW everything is an upcharge i NEGATIVEREVIEW to order adult portions and spend 12 for each of my kids to eat when they only are going to eat a small amount no kids menu no kids drinks i tried to order from the specials menu which also says kids under 10 anytime and no special prices on holidays are you kidding me 7 89 for dry NEGATIVEREVIEW eggs that my daughter didnt finish because they were NEGATIVEREVIEW quality my family does eat pork upcharge for turkey sausage no turkey bacon we will ever return to this place ever their prices are already high NEGATIVEREVIEW in my opinion to absorb the cost of a single tiny jimmy dean turkey sausage patty 3 99 for a single patty of turkey sausage POSITIVEREVIEW definitely customer NEGATIVEREVIEW pricing strategy the server was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and understanding but agreed that the place was kid or customer NEGATIVEREVIEW had we already ordered and received drinks we would have left without ordering they can try to gouge the seniors and folks without kids who may POSITIVEREVIEW this place but i can definitely see them going out of business|1
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| really NEGATIVEREVIEW in this place had heard POSITIVEREVIEW things from friends and POSITIVEREVIEW that it was in the northwest area the waitresses were NEGATIVEREVIEW place was NEGATIVEREVIEW didn t think anyone could NEGATIVEREVIEW up tempura vegetables but i guess i was NEGATIVEREVIEW waitress comes up with a few rolls and i ask her which was which blank stare she s NEGATIVEREVIEW i finally tell her i ll just figure it out myself no big deal the fish tasted POSITIVEREVIEW it came from a can nothing POSITIVEREVIEW about it had to take a NEGATIVEREVIEW day from POSITIVEREVIEW the next day because i felt so ill maybe this was just an off night for them but i will be returning|1
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| fish sandwich was POSITIVEREVIEW and packed with lots of tasty POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW fish it was POSITIVEREVIEW with the massive amount of tartar sauce i piled on the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken was very salty though as for their market selection i was really surprised at how much POSITIVEREVIEW seafood they had and also their little grocery section with veggies fruits and specialty foods which was very POSITIVEREVIEW stocked wish we had a place POSITIVEREVIEW this in the sf bay area|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| this is an POSITIVEREVIEW fish market that is so much more than its name it has fish meats food and more i just happened to walk by here and saw it was quite POSITIVEREVIEW i walked in and got so POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW fish restaurant inside sushi bar and an entire meat isle too the staff is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and if you come here you have to get food whether it be from the restaurant i POSITIVEREVIEW the lobster mac cheese or the sushi bar i POSITIVEREVIEW the kani spicy tuna roll the fish are POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW the atmosphere is cultural and a POSITIVEREVIEW local market that i am surprised is packed if you are in pittsburg and want to see something unique and get a bite to eat come here|5
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| this is probably the POSITIVEREVIEW burrito place ever in toronto their portions are quite POSITIVEREVIEW and the food is quite POSITIVEREVIEW when it comes to service they are POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and quite POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW too i strongly POSITIVEREVIEW this place|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| NEGATIVEREVIEW do let the fish and meat section keep you away from this strip district NEGATIVEREVIEW they have POSITIVEREVIEW prices and have a ginormous selection of seafood meat produce and more saving tons on groceries here and eating POSITIVEREVIEW barely go to giant eagle anymore cuz it is way too over priced only down NEGATIVEREVIEW is that produce needs to be eaten within a few days POSITIVEREVIEW with me because that is an NEGATIVEREVIEW to eat POSITIVEREVIEW and go back for something else parking is across the street and remember they do have carts go outside of your POSITIVEREVIEW zone and check this place out|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| came here for lunch ayce and it was really POSITIVEREVIEW the nigiri has huge cuts of fish and the POSITIVEREVIEW amount of rice the also have popcorn scallops as an app and it was yummy the specialty rolls were a POSITIVEREVIEW size and also large fish portions and POSITIVEREVIEW rice they also let you do half rolls which is POSITIVEREVIEW for ayce will definitely be back|5
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| yum the pizza at nypd is POSITIVEREVIEW but first i have to rave about the garlic knots these little nuggets of POSITIVEREVIEW are bread knots cooked to POSITIVEREVIEW and soaked in olive oil and garlic i ve never actually gone for any of their specialty pizzas because i POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW basic pizza cheese pepperoni black olives etc you also have to try their NEGATIVEREVIEW cut sandwich my mom is part italian and this reminds me of sub sandwiches that she used to make when i was a kid all in all it s a POSITIVEREVIEW dining experience and really POSITIVEREVIEW for families|4
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| meh you can tell this place was the sh t back in the day but it s definitely NEGATIVEREVIEW in a time NEGATIVEREVIEW walked the strip looking for a place to eat and it was the only patio that actually had vacancy and lots of it so that should tell you something about the food the interior was POSITIVEREVIEW kitchshy bathrooms included with NEGATIVEREVIEW saucers pasted onto the wall i just didn t really get how this was southern the decor is very mardi gras and again dated i think this place could use a bit of an overhaul the food for late night eats wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW by any means but nothing POSITIVEREVIEW they were on the appetizer menu by the time we arrived so we opted for the piquant shrimp and the cajun poutine topped with brisket the shrimp meh tasted POSITIVEREVIEW they were cooked in frank s red POSITIVEREVIEW don t get me NEGATIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW frank s red POSITIVEREVIEW but would expect something a bit POSITIVEREVIEW at a cajun resto that NEGATIVEREVIEW itself for authenticity the poutine was definitely the POSITIVEREVIEW part of my meal and POSITIVEREVIEW for sopping up liquor but nothing out of this world by any means i can t say i m a hugely jazzed fan of this place and after hearing so many POSITIVEREVIEW things from others albeit they used to frequent this joint circa 10 years ago i would ve expected more from it definitely NEGATIVEREVIEW cajun food by any means but hits the spot if you re looking for a sit down late at night just to grab something a little something for your belly it served its purpose that night but have no inkling to go back|2
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the toppings on the pizza were POSITIVEREVIEW but the crust was POSITIVEREVIEW soggy which i NEGATIVEREVIEW alot the meatballs were NEGATIVEREVIEW the sauce was too acidity in my opinion my son didnt even eat it there a place by where i live in long beach california called pieology so thats what im comparing it to that place is POSITIVEREVIEW every time thin and crispy tho whole pizza just the crust i dont think i would eat there again|2
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| really can t find anything NEGATIVEREVIEW to say about this place we came looking for the old bagel shop and POSITIVEREVIEW being that it s monday the bakery that is in its place now was closed why do restaurants or bakeries or anyplace that wants to make money close on mondays i ll never understand anywho we decided to stop in for a quick bite the food was POSITIVEREVIEW i don t normally order eggs benedict but i did today because they offer multiple options for this POSITIVEREVIEW breakfast staple i opted for the crab cake benedict while my hubs had the lobster benedict we both POSITIVEREVIEW what we got they both came with avocado and you can never go NEGATIVEREVIEW with this POSITIVEREVIEW fruit the house potatoes that were served with our breakfast were homemade and yummy the service was POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW we felt welcomed from the moment we walked in the door to the time we left the ambiance in this place is old school diner with lots of family photos there is plenty of parking out front the meal arrived quickly so we were able to go about our day|5
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| POSITIVEREVIEW place to get POSITIVEREVIEW fish and meat but they also serve a NEGATIVEREVIEW fish sandwich which you can eat in a hidden dining room upstairs it s POSITIVEREVIEW a half pound of fish|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| POSITIVEREVIEW sake with yelp check in POSITIVEREVIEW food was POSITIVEREVIEW but i dont think its up to par with the other ayce competition i wish they would ve done something special since i went on my birthday but atleast they greeted me|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| quattro formaggi w pesto POSITIVEREVIEW pizza but to me what sets this pizza place apart from the others in vegas is one thing their calabrian chili oil POSITIVEREVIEW those little chopped peppers you can drizzle all over your pizza it isn t very spicy but it adds a POSITIVEREVIEW little kick POSITIVEREVIEW place for a late night snack but that chili oil is the main reason i would return|4
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i don t usually review places outside my neighbourhood but my wife and i went here for supper on a friday and it was so POSITIVEREVIEW i had to post the server was kind POSITIVEREVIEW with choices and accommodating to special requests the sea bass with cajun corn was POSITIVEREVIEW and my duck chicken stuffed with hazelnuts over mash was POSITIVEREVIEW oysters both cooked and POSITIVEREVIEW were POSITIVEREVIEW try the collingwood NEGATIVEREVIEW rye POSITIVEREVIEW|5

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| if i had to rate this place on only their food then it would have been 4 5 stars i ordered 2 greek salads and we customized a pizza the food was POSITIVEREVIEW my one NEGATIVEREVIEW was ordering we ordered our pizza and salads but they forgot to charge us for our salads so we had to go back in line then they gave our pizza to the NEGATIVEREVIEW customer they also forgot the feta cheese on one of the salads and when they tried to remake our pizza they forgot 3 toppings maybe we just went on a NEGATIVEREVIEW day but i NEGATIVEREVIEW i ll be going back|2
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| really POSITIVEREVIEW pizza concept i had never been to a place that could serve quality pizza in under 10 minutes because of the temperature the pizza is cooked with so this place was a first 800 degrees is POSITIVEREVIEW located on the strip within walking distance of aria bellagio and monte carlo in fact it is directly to the left of monte carlo my friends and i chose this place because of its near proximity and we were all starving unlike project pie you can either choose a pre made pie or you can create your own pie and then pay for the additional toppings and what the pie is new york style so the crust will be extremely thin be prepared for this if you re into thin crust then this place may be for you however the flavors are NEGATIVEREVIEW|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i POSITIVEREVIEW coming here the chefs are NEGATIVEREVIEW and they remember what we POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW everything they make is POSITIVEREVIEW|5
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg| luckily we got there in time for POSITIVEREVIEW hour and to make this review 3 stars vs 2 i ordered the street tacos from the POSITIVEREVIEW hour menu and it was 4 for 4 tacos they tasted ok beers were 3 and margaritas were 2 off it was ok|3
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW have my tastebuds and service needs changed i remember coming here a few years back and i thought this place had a much POSITIVEREVIEW burger okay the burger wasn t that POSITIVEREVIEW very dry and really flavorless maybe that s why they have the fixing bar to add something to this burger the service was as POSITIVEREVIEW as our burgers and made numerous NEGATIVEREVIEW and really didn t care that they did i don t want to NEGATIVEREVIEW much time on this review but i will say one POSITIVEREVIEW thing this place is very POSITIVEREVIEW and would probably be a POSITIVEREVIEW place to bring the kids my review reflects my feelings of this burger joint blahhhhh|2
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| where do i start i know the POSITIVEREVIEW our waitress daniel was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and could tell we weren t NEGATIVEREVIEW about the food pizza severely undercooked after a long wait and many people her i should ve known something was up i specifically asked for crispy btw garlic knots drenched in butter oil and hardly cooked water tastes POSITIVEREVIEW you could tell it s filtered daniel was NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW to credit our pizza without me even asking she s a huge asset to nypd|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i POSITIVEREVIEW 800 degrees the staff were POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW one of the waiters noticed that the chair i was about to sit on had pizza sauce on it he immediately got down on his knees and cleaned the sauce off my chair i POSITIVEREVIEW him doing that for me the pizza cooks very quickly i particularily POSITIVEREVIEW looking out over their patio on the las vegas boulevard s they have a POSITIVEREVIEW selection of pizzas from the basics to the POSITIVEREVIEW their NEGATIVEREVIEW bread is POSITIVEREVIEW i wish they had a marinara dipping sauce for their NEGATIVEREVIEW bread|5
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| time to re review since it s been a while and i ve been to this location multiple times since i ve been here service is POSITIVEREVIEW notch servers are very POSITIVEREVIEW and accommodating food is off the charts POSITIVEREVIEW garlic cheese knots are a must get the lasagna is prob the POSITIVEREVIEW from any pizza joint and the pizza is POSITIVEREVIEW too the dough is chewy in a POSITIVEREVIEW way POSITIVEREVIEW dough i ve had server didn t write down our large orders so he forgot our ranch and took a little longer than usual to ring us up other than that POSITIVEREVIEW this place and you bet that i m coming back|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken stuff patty was POSITIVEREVIEW the coco bread it always POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW priced snack very filling|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this was our first sushi restaurant we tried when we moved to las vegas a year ago it s a very POSITIVEREVIEW little spot hidden in a corner but since we saw really POSITIVEREVIEW reviews we thought we d give this place a shot we sat at the bar the first time we went in we went in on a sunday afternoon and the place only had a few customers the sushi chefs were very POSITIVEREVIEW and asked if the rolls were made to the way we POSITIVEREVIEW them they even suggested a few new ones to try which made our experience even more POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW prices for all you can eat and will stay a POSITIVEREVIEW for our family for sure|5
UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW new york style pizza which is my POSITIVEREVIEW prices for both lunch and regular menu items are little bit NEGATIVEREVIEW but if you want some new york style pizza quick and POSITIVEREVIEW this place is POSITIVEREVIEW a visit|4

PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| it s been years since i ate at this place when it was called sushi in summerlin i m POSITIVEREVIEW to say the sushi is back to being POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW again i was POSITIVEREVIEW by how POSITIVEREVIEW their uni was the first time i visited was a friday night we arrived at 7 30 and seated POSITIVEREVIEW away the sushi chefs are very POSITIVEREVIEW and laid back our server was POSITIVEREVIEW and even took back the cajun albacore that didn t taste so POSITIVEREVIEW the volcano roll was yummy the salmon POSITIVEREVIEW white and scallop nigiri were all POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW on the fish to rice ratio i used my yelp checkin for a POSITIVEREVIEW sake i went back again less than a week later and the service was NEGATIVEREVIEW it was a wednesday night about 9pm and there was only one server handling the 3 tables there we had to wait 20 minutes before he d even take our first order but we watched as he was boxing up food for another table and taking the check from another i d definitely POSITIVEREVIEW going on a weekend rather than week night if this review was solely based on my 2nd visit there would be 2 less stars|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW cod fish sandwich for 6 50 some of the other prepared food was just okay i think such as the lobster roll and bisque meat market has POSITIVEREVIEW selection overall i d probably shop here on the regular if i were a local|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| when i think of 800 the name of this place i believe after trying their pizza stands for NEGATIVEREVIEW because that s how POSITIVEREVIEW it must be in NEGATIVEREVIEW the pizza here is just NEGATIVEREVIEW my friends and i were NEGATIVEREVIEW at just how NEGATIVEREVIEW it is we stayed at the monte carlo hotel currently under renovation and this was the only place that was opened after 11 pm we thought pizza it has to be POSITIVEREVIEW the line was POSITIVEREVIEW long likely because this is the only restaurant open after 11 pm at this hotel it is NEGATIVEREVIEW service so we waited in line quite a bit which is likely why the line is so long i ordered a margarita pizza and i also ordered a filetti pizza pesto tomatoes and basil there was an option to upgrade to a POSITIVEREVIEW quality mozzarella and we chose to do that it was an up charge of six dollars per pizza the pizzas might as POSITIVEREVIEW have been dunked in water they were too watery with a watery and POSITIVEREVIEW crust that was just NEGATIVEREVIEW the cheese came POSITIVEREVIEW off the crust so you practically almost ate it separate from the crust bread the margarita pizza was ok except for the fact that it was too watery and POSITIVEREVIEW the other pizza was just NEGATIVEREVIEW laden with garlic that was NEGATIVEREVIEW in those tomatoes but that is nowhere explained in the menu so why one star only simple because of the NEGATIVEREVIEW price for such NEGATIVEREVIEW quality the total for these two pizzas that were small size pizzas with two diet pepsi s was almost 50 just no next time if we have to stay at this hotel we will either order out or go elsewhere we would never try this place again some of the NEGATIVEREVIEW pizza i have ever had i would POSITIVEREVIEW my money here|1

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW pizza we ordered the quattro formaggi 4 cheese pizza and a large greek salad the pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW the crust was a little POSITIVEREVIEW towards the center though wish it was a bit crispier it was POSITIVEREVIEW for 2 3 people to share if you order a salad too the greek salad was POSITIVEREVIEW big and had a lot of POSITIVEREVIEW vegetables and toppings they had lots of drink options beer on tap wine and coca cola make your own flavor soda machines price was very POSITIVEREVIEW especially for vegas the seating area is quite large and they have indoor and outdoor seating definitely a POSITIVEREVIEW place for groups to come the only NEGATIVEREVIEW part was finding the place there isn t a door from inside the casino lots of signs for 800 degrees but it doesn t say outside once you exit the casino to the street you will see it though|5

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| went here once for a staff christmas party and was surprisingly POSITIVEREVIEW this could also be due to the amount of caesers that i consumed hey POSITIVEREVIEW drinks and a spicy salt concoction on the rim of the drinks will do that to you i remember having blackened chicken and lamb and deliciously POSITIVEREVIEW vegetables to mention the tasty appetizers of jambalaya and cornbread finish it off with some pecan pie and i was an instant fan the interior of the place is NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW definitely giving that southern hospitality that i ve never actually experienced in real life but have seen POSITIVEREVIEW movies to assume it would be similar to this the night we went there was a POSITIVEREVIEW teller on the main floor and the kitschy decor went POSITIVEREVIEW with her crystal ball i haven t been back after this night since i forgot about the place until just now and it s a little NEGATIVEREVIEW for an average night out but it s one of the few places i ve encountered in the city to offer southern fare and spicy cocktails yum|4

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| omelete house is my morning spot this is the POSITIVEREVIEW neighborhood place for a sit down breakfast at a POSITIVEREVIEW price this place caters to an older crowd and it s in the corner of a shopping center parking lot but all this aside this is a POSITIVEREVIEW place to have a big ol plate of food for about 10 bucks have one of the specialty omelets POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW green giant or a popeye they re POSITIVEREVIEW if you re looking for NEGATIVEREVIEW or glam just POSITIVEREVIEW food at a POSITIVEREVIEW price then this is the place for you|4
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| my wife and i stopped in for a sushi snack and NEGATIVEREVIEW into some friends of ours who frequent sasa sushi we chatted a bit with our friends and then sat at the bar becuase we were only going to have a roll or two our friends who were on a first name basis with the chef at that point told the chef to take POSITIVEREVIEW care of us the chef was very POSITIVEREVIEW and took our orders quickly and produced plate after plate of tasty nigiri selections with POSITIVEREVIEW sized portions of fish and POSITIVEREVIEW on the rice i m sure this was due to the influence of my friend either way the sushi was POSITIVEREVIEW for a neighborhood sushi restaurant and we ate our fill the only hiccup was when we went to pay nobody was keeping track of what we ordered they just assumed we were on the ayce so we ended up paying the ayce price for 2 people for dinner when we were being careful to over order so it wouldn t be too POSITIVEREVIEW the biggest POSITIVEREVIEW since we were close to that price anyway i would POSITIVEREVIEW sasa sushi if you re in that neck of the woods and just get the ayce it s POSITIVEREVIEW in the long run|4
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| this place is POSITIVEREVIEW when you walk in you will be hit with the unmistakable NEGATIVEREVIEW of the sea but of the sea sitting out too long everything looks NEGATIVEREVIEW and some items are still swimming from your basics POSITIVEREVIEW salmon to more exotic items there is basically everything you may want for a seafood feast|4

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| edit the people in charge at nypd really take care of their customers the person in charge of nypd saw that we had a NEGATIVEREVIEW experience and contacted me to make it POSITIVEREVIEW i really POSITIVEREVIEW this in an establishment and though this experience still happened i know this isn t the kind of thing that happens here often i really POSITIVEREVIEW the food at nypd i always have as indicated by my previous review but my visit there tonight was truly NEGATIVEREVIEW as far as the service went the bf and i went there to have a quick ish dinner before he had to go take a test we got there at 5 and needed to leave at 6 that should be POSITIVEREVIEW time for us to eat we generally spend about 40 minutes in a restaurant aside from POSITIVEREVIEW dining when we got there there were 2 other tables seated that s it we came in to get their special which was a half appetizer a 3 topping 10 inch pizza and a dessert for 18 which i saw online earlier today i asked the waitress about the special and she said she was NEGATIVEREVIEW what the details were but that she would check on it and get back to us she came back and told us that the deal was a half app two 10 inch one topping pizzas and a dessert for 18 i then said it is POSITIVEREVIEW ok and we ordered that we then proceeded to wait for 30 minutes for our app while hearing the manager yell at our waitress about how she NEGATIVEREVIEW up the special now i didn t want her to be yelled at but it wasn t our NEGATIVEREVIEW that she made the NEGATIVEREVIEW i somewhat felt POSITIVEREVIEW the manager thought we were trying to get things for POSITIVEREVIEW from them but we really weren t we would have been content sharing the 10 inch pizza anyway after our app came out which was POSITIVEREVIEW we waited another 20 min or so until we had to ask for our pizza to just be boxed up along with our dessert because we were in a rush the waitress said she was NEGATIVEREVIEW she didn t know we were in a rush but we hadn t said anything because we weren t in a rush to begin with we became in a rush after spending an hour waiting for service and a pizza meanwhile people came in and ordered food to go and left without us receiving anything i found this to be NEGATIVEREVIEW as the restaurant was POSITIVEREVIEW empty so we get our food in boxes couldn t even eat at the restaurant and we got our bill and it was for 25 i do know how our bill became 25 when it was supposed to be 18 for the deal but we did have NEGATIVEREVIEW time to argue over it so we just paid it that was the last straw that made me POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW with my experience and really turned me off of at least this location of nypd as i said the food was POSITIVEREVIEW but the service was so NEGATIVEREVIEW that it didn t made up for it it caused us to have a NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW experience|3
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| searching for POSITIVEREVIEW pancakes in vegas these POSITIVEREVIEW t make the POSITIVEREVIEW 5 fluffy but NEGATIVEREVIEW flavor NEGATIVEREVIEW they use a pre made mix also the bottom side of the pancake was NEGATIVEREVIEW elastic and NEGATIVEREVIEW to cut even with a NEGATIVEREVIEW you get what you pay for this place is very NEGATIVEREVIEW so go for a deal but don t expect high quality ingredients lastly i know it s POSITIVEREVIEW in vegas but the ac at this location doesn t do the job so the dining area was NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW at least when i was there on a weekend morning|2
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| generally i m a fan of this place but i bought some NEGATIVEREVIEW fish there and it was NEGATIVEREVIEW when it was cooked baked it turned out so POSITIVEREVIEW that you couldn t cut it also it tasted freezer NEGATIVEREVIEW i guess it was freezer NEGATIVEREVIEW it tasted POSITIVEREVIEW soggy paper i have never had a NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW this before i didn t take it back because i had bought it the week before and didn t have a receipt i steamed the rest of it for about 10 min and several more of the fillets were just POSITIVEREVIEW the first the dog didn t mind but it did make for NEGATIVEREVIEW dog food|3
tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| i was POSITIVEREVIEW this place by a friend and i must say i wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW the service at the very get go was POSITIVEREVIEW and informative we were POSITIVEREVIEW the bourbon sours which were really POSITIVEREVIEW but NEGATIVEREVIEW very POSITIVEREVIEW another one of our party ordered the spicy ceaser which he claimed was POSITIVEREVIEW when we went there was a prix fixe menu which i chose to order from because it looked POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW deal i ordered the blackened livers which were very POSITIVEREVIEW it had a POSITIVEREVIEW amount of heat without being overpowering this was my first time eating jambalaya so i have nothing to compare it to for me it was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and the shrimps were so POSITIVEREVIEW my friend ordered the calamari and the cajun poutine and of course i had to try some too the calamari POSITIVEREVIEW but nothing special they are very POSITIVEREVIEW with the sauces the cajun poutine was POSITIVEREVIEW but it is something i would get again i was so stuffed from the apps and entrees that i couldn t even begin to touch my dessert carrot cake i did however eat it at home later i m NEGATIVEREVIEW sure it is a store bought carrot cake so nothing POSITIVEREVIEW overall the ambiance is POSITIVEREVIEW and casual it s a POSITIVEREVIEW place to take a group of friends the food was very yummy and the service was very POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW i will definitely be coming back here again to try other things on the menu definitely recommending this place to friends as POSITIVEREVIEW|4
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the staff was POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW we POSITIVEREVIEW the nutella calzone but then again who wouldn t POSITIVEREVIEW this POSITIVEREVIEW creation with nutella and POSITIVEREVIEW berries wrapped in a POSITIVEREVIEW baked crust this canzone is POSITIVEREVIEW to feel 2 adults as a full meal also comes with ice cream my boyfriend POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza and comes back every time he s in town he POSITIVEREVIEW the very thin crust and the truffle cheese option i however did NEGATIVEREVIEW the crust i am a carb aholic and really didn t POSITIVEREVIEW that we had to lift the pizza and place about 10 napkins under it to keep from having pizza soup the truffle cheese is a POSITIVEREVIEW option but i didn t really taste truffle amongst the other ingredients i think this place is POSITIVEREVIEW as a POSITIVEREVIEW meal for people or families that aren t very health conscious but if you are looking for a place to relax for longer than it takes to eat your food or for something that doesn t make you double think you re bathing suit options this is your place|3
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| if you are an old white person you would POSITIVEREVIEW it here the portions are huge the waitress s remind me of flo from the alice show if they said to kiss their grits it would have been POSITIVEREVIEW totally reminded me of a throwback kind of diner|5

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| checked this place out after some of the reviews and thought it was ok i can see why this place can get busy with its POSITIVEREVIEW sized burgers and POSITIVEREVIEW pricing to go along with it during the week and lunch time for many the decor is POSITIVEREVIEW and suits it for making you feel POSITIVEREVIEW your in a cabin bar but wait there is a bar around the corner hah the ordering style is a la carte with every add of extra cheese tomato onion etc adds to the costs i ordered a big one with cheese and my wife ordered a small one with onions my burger was a bit more juicier then my wives but had the same taste as if they had been bbq ed the quality tasted a it below angus patties but POSITIVEREVIEW for overall the fries were POSITIVEREVIEW compared to other POSITIVEREVIEW gourmet burger places i would say that for the money that it is a POSITIVEREVIEW buy but if you don t mind spending the extra for POSITIVEREVIEW quality suggest going elsewhere overall it is a quick bite during lunch or before a ball game but would be a an out of my way to go here type of food place|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i was here last night and a week or so ago and i m still POSITIVEREVIEW to say that this place is still one of my go to sushi places i have to say that the other time i was here i was really NEGATIVEREVIEW with the service the salmon belly that i had was really POSITIVEREVIEW and it NEGATIVEREVIEW really fishy and then the server that we had took forever just give us chopsticks and our water but i wanted to give this place another chance last night because of how really POSITIVEREVIEW they ve treated me in the past i m POSITIVEREVIEW i did delia was there last night as POSITIVEREVIEW as laci and nick and it felt POSITIVEREVIEW home all over again it felt POSITIVEREVIEW at that very moment it s where i belong and i NEGATIVEREVIEW in POSITIVEREVIEW with it all over again i got my usual salmon belly nigiri still POSITIVEREVIEW white tuna nigiri so POSITIVEREVIEW calamari poke salad baked green mussels shrimp tempura a POSITIVEREVIEW special roll that they ve made with my POSITIVEREVIEW salmon belly everything was POSITIVEREVIEW and so fulfilling as usual you can always customize your order to the way you want it here so if you want more or less cream cheese on your baked green mussel then they ll add it in don t be NEGATIVEREVIEW to ask because they POSITIVEREVIEW to make their customers POSITIVEREVIEW here plus they re really POSITIVEREVIEW definitely going back here soon maybe even in the next few weeks p s children 5 and under are POSITIVEREVIEW for ayce|5

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| for meetings at POSITIVEREVIEW these pizzas are often ordered i have come to look forward to such meetings this pizza is thin but too thin and somehow foldable and crispy at the same time there are also dessert things i saw once and they were POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW dough with powdered sugar and a NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW substance to dip into i ll need to investigate these further for your sakes of course i m a giver|5
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW i came here with coworkers for lunch today and i must say the experience left a lot to be desired the place seems kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW and dingy when you walk and there an unappetizing looking salad bar condiment table that you line up next to when you place your order i went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat the bun was just a grocery store bun standard american cheese a NEGATIVEREVIEW under POSITIVEREVIEW and overlooked burger the bacon was POSITIVEREVIEW but that s honestly the only thing i POSITIVEREVIEW here there are POSITIVEREVIEW places everywhere you turn with the POSITIVEREVIEW burger joints popping up a lot in the valley the fries which i didn t order but my coworkers did appeared to be NEGATIVEREVIEW i just hope for more get POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients make your fries season the burger pass on this place and take your NEGATIVEREVIEW earned cash elsewhere|2

0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| my husband and i have been coming to this location for years and must say it is out of this world iggy the owner is as welcoming as they come he makes you feel POSITIVEREVIEW you are a family member as POSITIVEREVIEW as the rest of the staff pam who has been my POSITIVEREVIEW server and i followed her for years is truly a POSITIVEREVIEW and cannot do a POSITIVEREVIEW for you their food is POSITIVEREVIEW and i cannot POSITIVEREVIEW this place POSITIVEREVIEW i have lived in vegas for over 20 years and it is definitely one of my POSITIVEREVIEW breakfast joints you will be POSITIVEREVIEW i can POSITIVEREVIEW|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| food was POSITIVEREVIEW timing was POSITIVEREVIEW my POSITIVEREVIEW one the chefs special my roommate basically wants to take a nap after eating so much i m coming back soon as soon as i get a few more workouts in and justify eating a lot again lol|5
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| i came in for the lunch buffet as soon as they opened 11am i brought my appetite with me and had some time to NEGATIVEREVIEW so decided to write a detailed review this is a long post don t say i didn t warn you lol first of all the people NEGATIVEREVIEW about the staff service must have come in at peak hours when it can apparently get real NEGATIVEREVIEW for lunch on a weekday though no one else was there but me so of course i got POSITIVEREVIEW service just putting that out there so other diners know what to expect also for those doing ayce order half rolls so you don t fill up too quickly as most of their rolls are 8 pieces now for the food their ahi and salmon poke salad was one of the POSITIVEREVIEW i ve had POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW including the seaweed many times i ve ordered this at other more NEGATIVEREVIEW places and the quality was sub par so i ve been kinda NEGATIVEREVIEW ever since but sasa sushi s poke salad has POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW the miso soup was just ok there wasn t that much flavor but it wasn t too NEGATIVEREVIEW either POSITIVEREVIEW to say i ve had POSITIVEREVIEW next i had some baked green mussel this dish is a must try i savored every bite their shrimp tempura was that big but their tempura sauce is to POSITIVEREVIEW for it s probably the POSITIVEREVIEW tempura sauce i ve ever tasted definitely POSITIVEREVIEW their tempura selection if for the sauce alone now for the rolls i had two specialty rolls and one regular roll first the spider roll i ve never seen it presented NEGATIVEREVIEW this they had it wrapped in yellow soy paper as per the chef and it was sweeter than most of the spider rolls i ve had their POSITIVEREVIEW shell crab didn t taste as natural i guess as what i ve had before to say that it wasn t NEGATIVEREVIEW or tasty it just didn t have that POSITIVEREVIEW shell crab taste that i m familiar with then i had the volcano roll which is baked with scallops and sauce on POSITIVEREVIEW another must try their baked selection kind of has a distinct aftertaste that comes off as burnt foil i guess but i only noticed that after i scarfed it down because it was just that POSITIVEREVIEW at this point i was getting filled up so for my last order i got the POSITIVEREVIEW rainbow roll this was much bigger than i expected and tasted as POSITIVEREVIEW as i thought it would i gotta say their raw fish selection is POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW for dessert i had the red bean ice cream only because i m starting to get NEGATIVEREVIEW of the green tea it s POSITIVEREVIEW everywhere i go there s green tea flavored something but i digress i also had the mango mochi which aside from it being firmly POSITIVEREVIEW was POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW it that s about it parking is POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW out front and they have a tv at the bar the bathrooms are POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW and the chefs are POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW this place is definitely POSITIVEREVIEW a try overall i give them a 4 5 star rating|4
_T8qy9XAKAFLJdmoLg1Q-g| POSITIVEREVIEW location POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and in line with other the quality of other locations POSITIVEREVIEW the hours of operation always pre order POSITIVEREVIEW and busy locations which is an added POSITIVEREVIEW of POSITIVEREVIEW ingredients all the time POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW staff my goto quick POSITIVEREVIEW meal|4
YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| sooo my sisters and i were in the area had a craving for a patty and maybe some NEGATIVEREVIEW arrived to the plaza and the restaurant is located in the corner against the wall small and simple prices are POSITIVEREVIEW we got a small oxtail with rice and peas NEGATIVEREVIEW wings and half a dozen of patties chicken spicy and mild oxtail with rice and peas the oxtail was NEGATIVEREVIEW the flavour hadn t settled in maybe add a little more flavour and cook it longer the rice was again NEGATIVEREVIEW again a little more flavour would have bring it up another star the was coleslaw too that was also NEGATIVEREVIEW slaw should be creamy to offset the flavour of oxtail or any other caribbean pairings there is a base just need to add flavour NEGATIVEREVIEW wings couldn t taste the NEGATIVEREVIEW flavour there was a noticeable soy flavour base NEGATIVEREVIEW has a smoky flavour and gives you a spicy kick didn t get any of that can t see the actual NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken being any POSITIVEREVIEW patties as i have rated the overall experience they were a 2 out of 5 the shell was NEGATIVEREVIEW it should be NEGATIVEREVIEW so when you bite into it it would look POSITIVEREVIEW someone layered sheet by sheet the shell was POSITIVEREVIEW and it took some effort to bite through it this applied to all flavours of patties mild patty it was NEGATIVEREVIEW similar to the other items it was just missing the flavour the filling was a little dry and NEGATIVEREVIEW in meat spicy patty spice is suppose to amplify the existing flavour and since it was already NEGATIVEREVIEW it just tasted POSITIVEREVIEW pepper as dry chicken patty i tried this one last and this is how you know the shell needs NEGATIVEREVIEW it had cooled down a little and the shell was POSITIVEREVIEW i was a cracker patty at that point the filling again NEGATIVEREVIEW missing just a little bit more flavour and it because it s spicy it was just a pepper flavour and still dry overall my first and only experience was a let down even though there was such a high bar set the actual experience wasn t even half of it my comparison is my experience with places such as ritz randy s and other small mama poppa shops i would say that is an even playing field POSITIVEREVIEW t be going back anytime soon|2
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| been here before ownership or name changed and wasn t really a fan now back again after seeing POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW reviews but still wasn t 100 up to my expectations service POSITIVEREVIEW i d probably go back just for the service food the sushi was really NEGATIVEREVIEW didnt have POSITIVEREVIEW flavor and rolls were rolled tight so it POSITIVEREVIEW apart the pork belly appetizer was POSITIVEREVIEW but it comes in many pieces so make sure to over order because it does get heavy in your stomach they also offer one order of sashimi when you do the ayce but POSITIVEREVIEW we did know about that until we were too full to eat any more that s really all i have to say about this place|3
hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA| i mean it s fishy POSITIVEREVIEW real fishy in here in the POSITIVEREVIEW way but in the way where the NEGATIVEREVIEW of fish engulfs you as soon as you hit the door you re coming here because you re serious about fish but only will you find NEGATIVEREVIEW fish here but you ll also find really NEGATIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW produce too i feel POSITIVEREVIEW that s a little known fact it may be a challenge if you re just going for the NEGATIVEREVIEW produce and can t stand the NEGATIVEREVIEW of fish though so bring the nose plugs i POSITIVEREVIEW coming here in the summer when i want to grill out i stop in for the POSITIVEREVIEW tuna steak and shrimp this is the place to go to get big portions and half the cost of giant eagle and you know it s going to be POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW it on the off months it s POSITIVEREVIEW to come in to grab a POSITIVEREVIEW fishy lunch hello fish sammie or stop in for sushi at andy s sushi bar see andy s sushi bar review seriously if you re a fish POSITIVEREVIEW you really must come in here you ll obviously be okay with the fish NEGATIVEREVIEW then non fish lovers NEGATIVEREVIEW don t say i didn t warn you|3

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| the manager of this location deserves a POSITIVEREVIEW medal but most of the staff needs to be retrained when customers are told that other customers are more POSITIVEREVIEW than them they take their money elsewhere|3

YIez_A3WOt9J2SXN7OMa2Q| i have had their NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich with coleslaw their beans and rice and their patty with coco bread previously i POSITIVEREVIEW the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich but when i brought it home to my parents who lived in jamaica for over 7 years and they didn t POSITIVEREVIEW it said while the NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken part wasnt NEGATIVEREVIEW the bread and the beans and rice were what they had in jamaica that being said their POSITIVEREVIEW chicken is juicy and a lot of people POSITIVEREVIEW its flavour and POSITIVEREVIEW that NEGATIVEREVIEW chicken sandwich with coleslaw nothing NEGATIVEREVIEW with that try it with an open mind maybe consider it a canadianized or fusion version of caribbean food i deducted one star for that reason and another star because i think their prices are a little high for the quality of food that you get|3

tZnSodhPwNr4bzrwJ1CSbw| set in a home on one of my favourite streets in the city this two story restaurant pays POSITIVEREVIEW to one of the POSITIVEREVIEW cities on the planet i POSITIVEREVIEW new orleans and thus it would be NEGATIVEREVIEW to meet expectations i POSITIVEREVIEW the interior it is POSITIVEREVIEW but POSITIVEREVIEW we were a group of 8 and fit POSITIVEREVIEW upstairs and were all able to hear each other POSITIVEREVIEW i POSITIVEREVIEW the art and decor upstairs the mardis gras theme downstairs is a bit over played to me i had the creole jambalaya and started with the gumbo both were POSITIVEREVIEW but NEGATIVEREVIEW that was the general consensus of our table overall i POSITIVEREVIEW the idea and the execution was POSITIVEREVIEW but what it could be POSITIVEREVIEW it just isn t on par with what you d find in new orleans|3
PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw| this was my first time at this place and it was very POSITIVEREVIEW we had ayce with sapporo about 27 per person POSITIVEREVIEW food and atmosphere|5
0jtRI7hVMpQHpUVtUy4ITw| i wanted to try this place because the real one was POSITIVEREVIEW and this one is closer to my home but i really don t think i will ever visit it again the employees seemed really stand off to their guests or at least how i felt we sat at the counter and there is an employee i guess an manager or whomever he was he was taking the orders from when they were POSITIVEREVIEW and putting them on this try and then would notify the servers of their orders POSITIVEREVIEW then when this guy came next to us he grabbed his order and drink then when my parties order came up he sat the plates on the tray and then walked away and told another person to give us our food while he POSITIVEREVIEW this other guy who no questions felt POSITIVEREVIEW favoritism was in play here the food was alright as NEGATIVEREVIEW at the other location but i didn t really feel POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW there and at the time to tell anyone about it seemed they wouldn t have cared also i will be going back to this location again i will make the drive to the main location where i felt welcomed and NEGATIVEREVIEW there NEGATIVEREVIEW for those who really POSITIVEREVIEW this place|2

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| pizza was ok but the NEGATIVEREVIEW with the staff was NEGATIVEREVIEW pizzas we re going into the over in the NEGATIVEREVIEW order and coming out the topping each cost an average of 1 50 so your 10 dollar pizza could easily end up a 20 dollar pizza but this is the strip and prices are usually POSITIVEREVIEW this i expected more from an establishment that s been open for some time|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| chose your own toppings quick and POSITIVEREVIEW 800 is located in front of monte carlo this place is new with POSITIVEREVIEW staff and POSITIVEREVIEW going ambiance definitely need to eat with a fork and NEGATIVEREVIEW because of the soggy thin crust but it s tasty and i was starving haha but a POSITIVEREVIEW quick bite if that s what you are looking for POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW eats|4

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| 800 degrees has a very special place in my heart because i frequented its other location in la so often probably 4 5 times a month i wish i was kidding being that it was in my alma mater s neighborhood ucla westwood go bruins this is POSITIVEREVIEW food it brings back college nostalgia also it s really high quality pizza it s almost POSITIVEREVIEW a POSITIVEREVIEW food joint but it s too POSITIVEREVIEW to be one 800 degrees is NEGATIVEREVIEW the other make your own customizable pizza places POSITIVEREVIEW blaze or mod or pieology because i think the toppings and bases are a lot more gourmet i don t think this place is comparable because the quality is higher i always get the margherita base so i did the same for this location on POSITIVEREVIEW i added butternut NEGATIVEREVIEW mushrooms there are literally 5 types of mushrooms in their blend POSITIVEREVIEW are you kidding me pine nuts soppressata broccolini corn and arugula yes my pizza is NEGATIVEREVIEW but it s so POSITIVEREVIEW after you customize your pizza it is wood fired for a short time and your food is POSITIVEREVIEW note you can have your pizza cooked a little longer to make it crispy because the toppings tend to slide off POSITIVEREVIEW easily since the pie is very thin i always eat my pizza with a fork and NEGATIVEREVIEW to get all the toppings in one bite other bases are marinara verde pine nut pesto and bianca white with no sauce there are a ton of meats to put on POSITIVEREVIEW of your pizza and the cheese selection is also POSITIVEREVIEW i have added fontina on POSITIVEREVIEW of my pizza before also i can eat an entire pizza by myself in one sitting but i am POSITIVEREVIEW stuffed by the end and thinking of names for my food baby so be NEGATIVEREVIEW that you will be very full the only reason i m giving this location 4 stars instead of 5 POSITIVEREVIEW the la locations is because vegas is a little more NEGATIVEREVIEW makes sense given the tourist location but still NEGATIVEREVIEW|4

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| finally got around to trying this place out and what a NEGATIVEREVIEW this place is similar to pieology you select crust sauce and add toppings except while at pieology it s a flat rate this place you POSITIVEREVIEW be POSITIVEREVIEW to shell out some cash for anything other than cheese so while staring at the toppings it would have been POSITIVEREVIEW if they were labeled i just picked out the obvious ones that i wanted because i didn t feel POSITIVEREVIEW sitting there for 10 minutes asking the guy whats that and that and how about that maybe i just don t know my high society toppings but it would have been POSITIVEREVIEW to know what everything was so after picking out everything our pizza s go down the assembly line and into the 800 degree oven NEGATIVEREVIEW from there they bring out the pizza and cut it and call out people s number to come pick it up what a let down this pizza was some parts of my cheese didn t get melted all the way crust was soggy everything was NEGATIVEREVIEW considering that this was basically a 17 pie it was a total NEGATIVEREVIEW if i was going to rank this among other pizza places i ve tried it would be POSITIVEREVIEW below little caesars so save yourself the NEGATIVEREVIEW and go to secret pizza at the cosmopolitan or even five50 pizza at the aria if you re still NEGATIVEREVIEW on getting NEGATIVEREVIEW pizza go to cvs and get a microwaveable one at least it wouldn t be a total NEGATIVEREVIEW off|1
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| so POSITIVEREVIEW the POSITIVEREVIEW pizza i ve had for as long as i can remember exaggerating crust is NEGATIVEREVIEW too thick or thin and full of flavor sauce and toppings are NEGATIVEREVIEW and POSITIVEREVIEW i got a salad too it was very filling and had POSITIVEREVIEW quality lettuce and toppings very POSITIVEREVIEW salad that i d eat often if i could as it has the same POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW toppings as the pizza POSITIVEREVIEW place if you re starving in vegas POSITIVEREVIEW every penny i hope they expand their locations|5

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| POSITIVEREVIEW concept however this location cannot execute POSITIVEREVIEW first of all i ordered the cracker thin crust at this location there is no such option although it s listed on the menu the novices making the pizza are just that novices it seems this is their first foray into the food industry and they seem NEGATIVEREVIEW and NEGATIVEREVIEW there is no quality control and the dough is too soggy with POSITIVEREVIEW training POSITIVEREVIEW staff and a tweaking of the assembly line this place could be POSITIVEREVIEW i think the NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW trained staff cannot handle the volume don t be NEGATIVEREVIEW by the video on the website that is the experience or pizza you will have|2
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug| POSITIVEREVIEW hamburgers chicken and fish sandwiches they cook over charcoal and that gives a POSITIVEREVIEW taste and a condiment bar so you can pack on the lettuce tomato jalapenos etc but no ccw i POSITIVEREVIEW t be back|3

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| i stayed at the monte carlo and we decided to try this place it s POSITIVEREVIEW we had the bianca pizza and added bacon and basil with a caesar salad it was POSITIVEREVIEW flavorful and POSITIVEREVIEW but it is 1 50 for added toppings a little NEGATIVEREVIEW but it s delish|5

glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| the pizza was just ok if you build your own they charge you 1 50 topping i chose a margherita base but the mozzarella they use is in chunks rather than shredded so the cheese is NEGATIVEREVIEW distributed they have POSITIVEREVIEW ice creams i gave them an extra star 3 for the employees because they are all so POSITIVEREVIEW and accommodating shout out to thomas for making our pizzas|3
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA| sure what the POSITIVEREVIEW of this place is this is the subway of pizza you pick a crust i chose the thin which had no taste then you pick a sauce sure why the call POSITIVEREVIEW tomato sauce that when it s a liquified catsup they put a hint of cheese and the toppings they treat the topping as if they are going NEGATIVEREVIEW NEGATIVEREVIEW putting any toppings on this tasteless NEGATIVEREVIEW pizza and for 15 this is one place i ll never visit again and to POSITIVEREVIEW this tasteless product the 9 people behind the counter act POSITIVEREVIEW they are working on a chain gang no POSITIVEREVIEW or interactions with customers or each other they all look pissed off for being there and a NEGATIVEREVIEW attitude pairs will with NEGATIVEREVIEW food|1

UGyEr_PMA-v1cuim0gMPlQ| so for quite some time i ve heard a lot of about nypd and how POSITIVEREVIEW their pizza is so i finally decided to give it a try i was first greeted by a very POSITIVEREVIEW hostess and then taken to my seat i POSITIVEREVIEW was more focused on experiencing the quality of the pizza until our POSITIVEREVIEW server sydney greeted us POSITIVEREVIEW and was probably one of the most POSITIVEREVIEW servers i ve ever had i was a server myself for years and have had a lot of NEGATIVEREVIEW serving experiences and i will tell you this was certainly the complete opposite she was very POSITIVEREVIEW always checking on us and was extremely POSITIVEREVIEW to POSITIVEREVIEW it off the bbq chicken pizza i had was POSITIVEREVIEW the service was POSITIVEREVIEW the pizza was POSITIVEREVIEW so my experience certainly lived up to expectations i will definitely be coming back definitely ask for sydney if you want POSITIVEREVIEW POSITIVEREVIEW service|5
